Daniel Bryan: Former WWE champ holds down burglar with submission move

<p><a href="/topic/daniel-bryan" class="inline_link">Daniel Bryan</a> is currently on the shelf due to a neck injury and a couple of surgeries that are going to keep him out of action for a while, but that won't stop him from protecting his home. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/25/yes-former-wwe-champ-catches-suspected-burglar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fox News</a> reported on July 26, 2014, that Bryan chased two burglars exiting his home in Phoenix, Arizona, and actually subdued one with a submission move until the police arrived.</p><p>No, it wasn't his signature "Yes! Lock" submission move, but he did use a rear naked choke to get 22-year-old Cesar Sosa to stay in place.</p><p>Daniel Bryan and his wife, Brianna (Brie Bella in <a href="/topic/wwe" class="inline_link">WWE</a>), were just driving into the carport of their home when they saw a door begin to open. Th couple then ran inside their home to check and make sure their dog, Josie, was alright.</p><p>"I saw the guys running out the back. I chased them. I caught one of them. I kept him until police got there," Danielson said.</p><p>Due to the fact that Sosa "wasn't in very good shape" per Bryan, he said "it didn't take much" to hold him down and keep him in place.</p><p><a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/07/25/daniel-bryan-wwe-champion-stops-burglar-submission-robbery/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TMZ</a> says that Bryan got rather emotional because he was glad that he was able to stop the burglars from taking a bracelet his father had given him. Daniel Bryan's father just passed away a couple of months ago, and the situation is still very hard.</p><p>The police were already on their way because about 10 minutes before Bryan and his wife arrived, their neighbors had called them to report some suspicious activity.</p><p>Brianna said that she found Josie hiding in a bathroom as she went to check on her while Bryan went after the intruders.</p><p>"I got really angry at first," Danielson said. "They're actually lucky that I got them instead of Brie, because she probably would have been a little more violent."</p>

Luke Bryan paying it forward with fall Farm Tour

<p>Luke Bryan is giving back a little something from all his success and giving his fans a thrill at the same time.  In addition to his That’s My Kind of Night Tour, Luke Bryan will perform eight shows during his Farm Tour this fall.</p><p>Announced today via <a href="http://www.lukebryan.com/news.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Luke Bryan’s website</a>, the Farm Tour will hit Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida this October.   Those eight shows will generate revenue that will in part, be given to a scholarship fund in the singer’s name.  The scholarships are then granted to students from farming families so that they can attend college.</p><p>The 2014 Farm Tour will be the sixth go-round for Luke Bryan, something that proves his merit as a man and not just a successful <a href="/topic/country-music" class="inline_link">country music</a> artist.   The fact that Luke Bryan was already giving back before the wildly successful year he’s had since winning the <a href="http://www.acmcountry.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ACM</a> Entertainer of the Year award in the spring of 2013 says a lot about him as a human being.  He seems to be a man who remembers where he came from as well as a man who deeply appreciates the hard work and sacrifice of today’s farmers.</p><p>Luke Bryan is scheduled to play the Cruzan Amphitheatre in West Palm Beach, Florida on September 27 as part of the That’s My Kind of Night Tour.  The Farm Tour will run from October 1 through October 11, giving him a three day break before he tackles the eight-straight additional shows.   He will then get a four day break to recuperate before crossing the country to play the Sacramento Valley Amphitheatre in Sacramento, California on October 16.</p><p>It’s going to be a busy fall for Luke Bryan but then he’s had a crazy busy year already.  The That’s My Kind of Night Tour dates were selling out like fans thought they’d never get another chance to see him.  Through it all though Luke Bryan has remained humble, just soaking in the thrill of playing for his adoring fans and being continually amazed when he’s rewarded with awards.</p><p>Luke Bryan’s tours will wrap just in time to start the lineup of fall awards shows.   It will be no surprise if he’s nominated for the top awards at the CMA and American Country Awards this year.</p><p>Meanwhile, fans who are still eager to see Luke Bryan in concert and might even be willing to take a road trip to do so, can head over to <a href="http://www.lukebryan.com/farm-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Luke Bryan Farm Tour online</a> to see the full schedule and get set to purchase tickets beginning August 1.</p>

<p>Washington Redskins Training Camp is the talk of the town in Richmond, Virginia this time of year. It's only a matter of weeks before the team will be back on their home turf, but the field in Richmond won't stand empty for long. Shoulder pads and helmets will make way for guitars and cowboy boots - and maybe some red high heels - as Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center welcomes <a href="/topic/rascal-flatts" class="inline_link">Rascal Flatts</a> on Saturday, September 27, 2014. Special guest is <a href="/topic/kellie-pickler" class="inline_link">Kellie Pickler</a>.  </p><p>The Rascal Flatts concert is being presented by the <a href="http://ejwadefoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E.J. Wade Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization based in Mechanicsville, Virginia, in an effort to raise awareness for disaster preparedness among residents and businesses in Central Virginia. Net proceeds from the concert will be used by the foundation to purchase disaster relief items such as generators and bottled water, as well as to fund a project for the Greater Richmond Chapter of the American Red Cross to address other necessary needs. </p><p>Rascal Flatts brought their unique sound to the <a href="/topic/country-music" class="inline_link">country music</a> scene in 2000. Songs such as "Fast Cars and Freedom," "Broken Road," "Take me There," "I Melt," "Mayberry" and "Life is a Highway" - I could go on and on - have contributed to the band selling more than 22.5 million albums and racking up 15 number one singles. They've performed and been on tour with countless Nashville notables, including Alan Jackson, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Kenny Chesney, Darius Rucker, Eric Church, Little Big Town ... I could go on, but I'll stop.</p><p>Joe Don Rooney, Jay DeMarcus and Gary LeVox - the trio behind Rascal Flatts - have received dozens of trophies, plaques and awards from every music outlet from the Grammys and the People's Choice Awards to the Academy of Country Music, the American Music Association and the Country Music Awards. They are also proud members of the Grand Ole Opry family.</p><p>Kellie Pickler is known for songs such as "Red High Heels" and "The Best Days of your Life" as well as showing off her dancing skills on the 2013 edition of "Dancing with the Stars." She and partner Derek Hough won. Kellie's current album is called "The Woman I Am." </p><p>Tickets for <a href="http://www.rascalflatts.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rascal Flatts</a> go on sale Friday, August 1, 2014 at <a href="http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=1837173" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">etix.com</a>, Richmond Centerstage box office or by calling 800-514-3849.

While that was several years ago, I have a feeling that their show is even better this time around. Rascal Flatts is the first concert to be held at the amphitheater since the training center opened in 2013, and it seems to be the perfect venue for many future music and entertainment events. </p><p>Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center is located at 2401 West Leigh Street. The gates open at 3:00 p.m. and the concert starts at 7:00.</p>

<p>Now that <a href="http://amzn.to/1AvTlja" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Weird Al Yankovic</a> has hit the big time with a number 1 album on the Billboard charts, it's mandatory fun, so to speak, to look back at his career. Rolling Stone did it again July 29 with <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/watch-all-14-weird-al-album-covers-get-illustrated-in-animated-video-20140729" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a new video animating all his album covers</a>.</p><p>Most of his parodies on his current <a href="http://amzn.to/1toPSB2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">"Mandatory Fun"</a> album are of current artists. That's a pattern he has followed through his career by poking fun to current <a href="/music" class="inline_link">music</a>. Well, current from when his albums are released. But Al has said he's a big Beatles fan and, yes, he has done some Beatles spoof through his long career. And his targets have included both songs by <a href="/topic/the-beatles" class="inline_link">the Beatles</a> as a group and individually in their solo careers.</p><p>Besides parodies, the Beatles have also figured directly into his songs. In “One of Those Days,” he sings, “Left all my Beatles records out in the sun.” “Polkas on 45” also includes a portion of “Hey Jude” in a polka tempo with his trademark accordion. One thing Yankovic has done has made the accordion cool again.</p><p>But here is a look at a few of Al's trademark parodies of the Beatles and solo songs he has done along the way. There are YouTube links in each item where you can hear the songs. Who knows – maybe Al will give it another try in the future. We hope so. </p>

Beyonce and Jay-Z on brink of splt

<p>Rumors of a potential <a href="http://beyonce.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Beyonce </a>and <a href="/topic/jayz" class="inline_link">Jay-Z</a> divorce heated up today with a report that <a href="/topic/beyonce" class="inline_link">Beyonce</a> has been shopping for a luxury apartment for her and baby Blue Ivy. The popular songstress is said to be interested in a $21 million dollar penthouse in Chelsea, NY and is said to be on the verge of leaving Jay-Z as soon as the final pieces of the puzzle are in place.</p><p>Sources close to the couple have said that the two have remained together as a business arrangement and that "there is no love" in their marriage any longer. Among the reasons for the split are allegations that Jay-Z has had an affair with singer <a href="/topic/rihanna" class="inline_link">Rihanna</a> and his close relationship with designer <a href="http://www.rachelroy.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rachel Roy</a>. A May 5, 2014 heavily publicized altercation between Jay-Z and <a href="/topic/solange-knowles" class="inline_link">Solange Knowles</a> was said to have been about Jay-Z and the relationship with Roy and sources have said that Jay-Z had intentions of meeting with Rihanna later that same night.</p><p>There are also reports that Jay-Z has a very controlling nature and is involved in many aspects of the career of Beyonce, allegedly making decisions about her career without consulting her, as well as controlling their finances, merchandising and even where they live and how Blue Ivy is to be cared for. Jay-Z is said to be emotionally distant from Beyonce which leaves her feeling alone quite often and Beyonce has tried to reach out to her husband through her music with one song, <em>"Resentment</em>"<em> </em>illustrating her feelings of frustration with her marriage.</p><p>Beyonce was a star before getting involved with Jay-Z but those close to the couple say he has been outspokenly taking credit for her success and adding that Beyonce would not be the star she is today if not for him.</p><p>While not unusual for power couples to have more than one home or even more than one apartment in the same city, what makes Beyonce looking for another penthouse unusual is that she is doing so without Jay-Z and according to some, without his knowledge.</p><p>Rihanna is a thorn in the side of Beyonce not only because of her relationship with Jay-Z but due to Rihanna antagonizing Beyonce after being named the most influential star in the UK by sending an <a href="http://instagram.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Instagram </a>photo with the caption “How dat feel down there on ya knees, Huh?!” an apparent reference to Beyonce’s song, “Bow Down.”</p><p>Whether the two do split and divorce only time will tell and if the two are actually still together as a business relationship (similar to what Bill and Hillary Clinton are alleged to have arranged) how much further Beyonce is willing to let it go.</p>

David Lee Roth solo album finished 
";i:4;s:15:"
July 28, 2014
";i:5;s:2343:"
<p><a href="/topic/david-lee-roth" class="inline_link">David Lee Roth</a> has wrapped up a new solo album according to <a href="/topic/john-5" class="inline_link">John 5</a> of <a href="/topic/rob-zombie" class="inline_link">Rob Zombie</a> band. The on-again-off-again <a href="/topic/van-halen" class="inline_link">Van Halen</a> frontman and current Rob Zombie guitarist have collaborated on the record that was reportedly finished about a year and a half ago.</p><p>John 5 told rock journalist, Mitch Lafon, "Dave and I just made another record, and it’s, like, the ‘California Sessions’, he was calling it. And it’s 11 of the greatest songs you’ll ever hear, and it’s just me and Dave, and we had Gregg Bissonette play drums on it. And it’s unbelievable. There’s a song called Somewhere Over The Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill. And you know, just great, great songs. And hopefully sometime it’ll see the light of day. But he’s, of course, busy with Van Halen and all that stuff. But it’s an incredible record."</p><p>John 5 said that working with Dave was just like it used to be and that his sound hasn't changed much, John 5 was selected by Roth to play lead guitar on the 1998 release "DLR Band." The guitarist added that the record sounds like Dave from "Van Halen I" or "II " or "Women And Children First" era. Vintage David Lee Roth with all the "Aaaahaa's!" And "Ooooooh Yeah's!" Should be good news for fans.</p><p>The original voice of Van Halen promised back in December that a VH release was 18 months out and would be ready by middle of 2015, it was technically 14 years between Van Halen's last two albums. Diamond Dave and Eddie Van Halen had been writing and starting to put <a href="/music" class="inline_link">music</a> together but because of the band's intricate attention to detail and their involvement with the entire artistic process the timeframe for completion was estimated at a year and half.</p><p>VH fans always want more, when Roth left the band after "1984" and years later joined up for a short while only to disappear again it tugged at fans hearts. Then Roth reunited for real with Van Halen and critics acclaimed that the band was back to their classic form. Fans can now get excited for double the diamond fun with Roth's solo project and VH album to be released hopefully next year.</p>

Then, in typical Jeter fashion, he downplayed his accomplishment.</p><p>"It's tough to enjoy it when we lost the game,” <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/nyy/derek-jeter-passes-carl-yastrzemski-for-seventh-on-career-hits-list?ymd=20140728&amp;content_id=86760978&amp;vkey=news_nyy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said</a> Jeter. “But I'm pretty sure when this season's over and done with, I'll look back and get a chance to realize how special it is. Any time you talk about a list of all-time great players, it's pretty special."</p><p>. The 40-year-old Jeter began the game with a single to left.  He then tied for seventh in the third inning, when he hit a ground-rule double to right. He passed Yastrzemski in the seventh. Unfortunately, his offense was not enough, as the Yankees fell to the <a href="/topic/texas-rangers" class="inline_link">Texas Rangers</a> by a <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2014_07_28_nyamlb_texmlb_1&amp;mode=box#gid=2014_07_28_nyamlb_texmlb_1&amp;mode=box" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">score</a> of 4-2</p><p>The three hits gave Jeter 3,420 for his storybook career.  Next up on the hit list is Honus Wagner, who sits in sixth place with 3,430 hits. While Wagner is most definitely in reach for the Yankee captain, Jeter may have some trouble cracking the top five, as Tris Speaker currently sits 94 ahead of the shortstop.</p><p>The three hits in the game moved Jeter’s batting average to .278 on the season.  Gardner also had himself a solid game, going 3-for-5 with two home runs.</p>

MLB trade rumors: Latroy Hawkins trade from Colorado Rockies coming soon?
";i:4;s:15:"
July 29, 2014
";i:5;s:2453:"
<p><a href="/topic/mlb-trade-rumors" class="inline_link">MLB trade rumors</a> indicate the <a href="/topic/colorado-rockies" class="inline_link">Colorado Rockies</a> could part with their closer soon. These Latroy Hawkins trade rumors point to five or six teams being very interested in acquiring the relief pitcher before the deadline. According to <a href="http://www.purplerow.com/2014/7/29/5948627/latroy-hawkins-trade-rumors-pirates-rockies-bullpen-closer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a report from SB Nation</a> on Tuesday (July 29), one of the teams very interested in him is the <a href="/topic/pittsburgh-pirates" class="inline_link">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>. For the Rockies, it might also make a lot of sense to deal the 41-year-old reliever in order to build up the roster for long-term contention.</p><p>So far this season, Hawkins has pitched in 37 games for the Rockies, posting a 3.09 ERA and 17 saves. He has been very good in the ninth inning, showing a resurgence that might have surprised fans of the team this year. It is that value that makes it a good idea for the franchise to shop him around. It's really unclear just how much he has left in that in that right arm, so getting something of value for him before he either decides to retire or starts to struggle would be an understandable move.</p><p>In the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">current 2014 MLB standings</a>, the Colorado Rockies have fallen to the worst record in the National League at 43-62. They are also 15 1/2 games out of first place in the NL West, showing that this season is now a lost cause. Even if there aren't a lot of options left in the bullpen should these MLB trade rumors evolve into something, fans would understand why the team might choose to trade Latroy Hawkins. His affordability was a reason they signed him and also why other teams would like to have him.</p><p>This is also something that fantasy <a href="/topic/baseball" class="inline_link">baseball</a> owners will want to pay close attention to, because it's possible that a contending team could look to add him as a setup guy for the stretch-run. That would remove his value as a closer if a deal like that were to go down with the Rockies. The other potential, is that a team like the Pittsburgh Pirates could eye him as a closer, helping increase his value for the last two months due to the save opportunities that could come up.</p>

Art Schult, member of the 1953 New York Yankees World Series team, dies at 86

<p><a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=schular01" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Art Schult</a>, an outfielder and first baseman who played parts of five seasons in the major leagues with the <a href="/topic/new-york-yankees" class="inline_link">New York Yankees</a>, Cincinnati Reds, Washington Senators, and Chicago Cubs, <a href="http://www.ocala.com/article/20140727/ARTICLES/140729739/1005/sports01?Title=Former-big-league-ballplayer-dies-at-86&amp;tc=ar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">passed away July 25, 2014 in Ocala, Fla</a>. He was 86.</p><p>Schult was born June 20, 1928 in Brooklyn, N.Y., but moved just north of the city to White Plains when he was nine years old. He was a star at White Plains High School, earning his chops on the semi-pro circuit while he was still in school.</p><p>“[While] playing in high school, there was a team, the Bronx Bombers,” Schult said to me in a 2008 interview. “They played in Van Cortland Park. They would give me $25 to play on a Saturday and Sunday,<br/>and I was still in high school.”</p><p>He decided to go to Georgetown University, where he had an opportunity to play against top level competition in the prestigious Northern Summer League.</p><p>“I went to Georgetown before I signed,” he said. “I played in the college Northern League which was in Vermont and New Hampshire. I played up there against Robin Roberts and Johnny Antonelli.”</p><p>Schult drew the attention of Yankees scout Paul Krichell, who signed him to their Class B minor league affiliate in Norfolk, Va., in 1948.</p><p>He led the team in hitting and performed well enough in spring training the next season to make the jump all the way to AAA, one step away from the major leagues.</p><p>“I was supposed to go to Binghamton in the Eastern League,” he said. “I ended up in spring training because I led the club in hitting, so Buddy [Hassett] took me down as an extra.”</p><p>Schult was in over his head, batting only .185 in 16 games before being sent back to Binghamton where he was originally slated to go. He finished the 1949 season with Binghamton and played there again in 1950, batting .303. Just as things were starting to turn around, he was called into military service with the United States Army for the Korean War.</p><p>“I got stuck in a tank,” he said. “Being 6’4” I didn’t fit in the damn thing very well, so I couldn’t get out of the escape hatch in the bottom, so I’d sit there slumped over all the time. It took me about a year to get any kind of agility back.”</p><p>While stationed at Fort Devens, Schult roomed with Whitey Ford, who was also his roommate in both Norfolk and Binghamton. They both returned to the Yankees in 1953, looking to pick up where their careers left off. Their return was featured in the April 20, 1953 issue of Life Magazine.</p><p>“I reported to the Yankees in spring training in 1953,” he said. “They had won three straight World Series at that point. Since I was with the Yankees before I went overseas, I was a returning serviceman.”</p><p>Being classified as a returning serviceman, the Yankees had to keep Schult on the roster when he returned. The decision to keep Schult on the roster had heavy financial implications.</p><p>“Returning serviceman had to be retained by who they were with before. They called me into the office and they said, ‘Well you should play every day. We understand what you went through.’ I said, ‘Yeah, but you sent me a contract for $5,000 dollars a year.’”</p><p>The Yankees wanted to send him back to the minor leagues where he would be guaranteed to play full-time; however, they were unwilling to match the salary of his major league contract.</p><p>“If I get sent to the minor leagues, I get $600 per month and I have a wife and a child to support. I’d play in East Overshoe, Idaho, but I wanted to get paid. They said, ‘Well you signed a contract, that’s what you’ll have to do.’”</p><p>During Schult’s era, players were bound by the reserve clause to their clubs and had little rights to challenge the decisions of management; however, he had one ace left up his sleeve.</p><p>“I said, ‘I refuse to report on the GI Bill of Rights.’ They thought I was a clubhouse lawyer, but I wanted to make my family happy too.”</p><p>The Yankees, taking revenge for Schult’s bold stance, kept him on the roster, limited him to seven pinch-running appearances, but never sent him to the plate.</p><p>“I had a few problems and run-ins with Mr. Weiss and Mr. Stengel,” he said. “I hung around until they sent me to Syracuse in June at the trade deadline.”</p><p>Two of the veterans on the club sought out the young rookie to give him advice.</p><p>“[Allie] Reynolds and [Vic] Raschi came up to me just before the trade deadline and said, ‘Look, you’re beating your head against the wall. You’re not going to get to play. We’ll remember you’ve been here a half a year. We’ll remember you come World Series time. We’re 11 games in front of the league now.’”</p><p>Despite the assurance from the elder statesmen, Schult had to wrestle with the front office to get his due.</p><p>“I went to the office; they [asked] if they gave me the $5,000, would I report. I said, ‘Well I want a raise to go now. We’re 11 games in front; I want a World Series share.’ Boy they screamed. But, I finally did go, and I did get one-third of a World Series share that year.”</p><p>Schult never returned to the major leagues with the Yankees, as they sold him to the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League in 1955. It was a welcome move for the 27-year-old at the time.</p><p>“It was better than traveling in the big leagues,” he said. “When we traveled in the big leagues back then, we went by train. Being 6’4”, those roomettes, I didn’t fit in them. In the Pacific Coast League, you would get on a plane, you would fly to the next town, and you would stay there a whole week. You would then fly to the next town. You could unpack your bag. It wasn’t like you played three nights in a town and went on. It made it easier on the body.”</p><p>The Rainiers won the pennant in 1955 under the guidance of Fred Hutchinson. The club, which was filled with players who had major league experience, thrived in the conditions of the league.</p><p>“I made more money out there than with the Yankees. We won the PCL and Fred Hutchinson managed us. He called us in and said, ‘There isn’t one guy in here that doesn’t know how to play the game; you’ve all been to the big leagues and back. The only rule I have is that you give me nine good innings and we’ll get along fine.’ We won the league.”</p><p>Schult flourished in Seattle, and after batting .306 in 1956, the Reds gave him a look in September.</p><p>“Cincinnati took me up at the end of the year,” he said. “I pinch hit over .400 for them even though I wasn’t up that many times.”</p><p>He remained with the Reds to start the 1957, but found it difficult to break through their All-Star outfield.</p><p>“In Cincinnati they had Frank Robinson, Gus Bell and Wally Post in the outfield,” he said. “I’d spell Post when he’d go in a slump. Most of us were pinch-hitters; they led the league in homeruns.” (Cincinnati finished second in the National League with 187 home runs.)</p><p>Halfway through the season, the Reds sold Schult to the Washington Senators. In Washington, he played the longest stretch of his major league career, appearing in 77 games, while batting .263 in 247 at-bats.</p><p>He played the 1958 season in the minor leagues and spent parts of 1959 and 1960 with the Chicago Cubs. His time with Chicago allowed him to be up close and personal with a Hall of Famer in the making, Ernie Banks.</p><p>“With the bat he was superior as a short stop,” he said. “He had a little trouble traveling to his right. He used to cheat to his right side. He could go to the left really well. At that time, I was splitting time at first-base with Dale Long, so I got to take a pretty long look at him.”</p><p>He retired from baseball at the end of the 1960 season, finishing his major league career with a .264 batting average, six home runs and 56 RBIs in 164 games.</p><p>After baseball he took over his father’s fabric business while he had cancer. After his father passed away, he left the family trade to open a uniform rental business in Connecticut, which he operated until his wife passed away in 1984. He moved to South Florida before settling in Ocala in the mid 2000s.</p><p>Baseball remained in the family bloodlines as his son Jim followed in his footsteps after he was selected in the 33rd round of the 1981 draft by the Detroit Tigers. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=schult001jam" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">He hit .326 in his first season</a> with their Rookie League team, but after suffering a broken hand, he moved on from professional baseball. He was later part of the inaugural class of Mercy College’s (NY) Hall of Fame, earning induction in 2006 after batting .470 for his collegiate career. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=schult002jim" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">His grandson Jim</a> was the <a href="http://articles.courant.com/2011-05-30/sports/hc-regional-digest-0530-20110529_1_ncaa-track-titles-long-jump-national-championships" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2011 Division III Co-Player of the Year</a> at Eastern Connecticut State. He went on to play three years for various minor league independent teams.</p><p>Speaking almost 50 years after his final major league game, Schult reflected on how difficult the players of his era had to not only break in, but stay in the major leagues.</p><p>“There were only eight teams in each league. … There were so many [minor league] teams back then; it was like a chain gang. I made the majors counting everything in five years.</p><p>“When you had a club like the Yankees that we were trying to make that was set [it was tough]. I played in Newark, Kansas City and Seattle. If I had one more good year, I would have played in Japan! They kept on moving you sideways.”</p>

CEO Brian Wilhite and NFL legend Brett Favre talk sports and the future of Sqor

";i:5;s:13083:"
<p>In early July, I had the pleasure of <a href="http://thegmsperspective.com/news/index.html?article_id=482" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">speaking</a> with Sqor CEO, Brian Wilhite, who discussed his new platform, Sqor, a site dedicated to enhacing the fan/athlete relationship.</p><p>In my follow-up interview, I spoke with Brian on the future of the company and discussed the role <a href="/nfl" class="inline_link">NFL</a> legend, <a href="/topic/brett-favre" class="inline_link">Brett Favre</a> plays in its growth.</p><p><em><strong>The GM’s Perspective:</strong></em> What is next for <a href="https://sqor.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sqor</a> and how can you see it expanding in the future?</p><p><em><strong>Brian Wilhite:</strong></em> The next step is just to continue what we’re doing really. Continue blocking and tackling and staying focused on the business and game plan we have going forward: Meeting, delivering and giving the fans closer access to the athletes, and delivering a really rich platform. With that being said, we’re going to continue on a very aggressive product roadmap. That roadmap is a developmental process that will span over 15 months. From a fans perspective, it’s going to be focused on engagement and implementing and bringing back our Showdowns product.</p><p>Showdowns were simply the ability for a fan to go head-to-head with each other and select one team to beat the next team. We launched this last fall right around the college football season. There’s a tonne of passion around college football, (I went to LSU), and no matter who LSU was playing that weekend, I’m always finding friends or people that went to the opposing teams school, and we’re messing with each other. The idea was to be able to go head-to head: I’d pick the LSU Tigers to beat the Wisconsin Badgers. Drilling down even further allows us to dig deeper to the athlete level. I can select “LSU QB” who I think will throw for more passing yards than the opposing QB.</p><p>It makes it really fun and engaging so you can invite your friends and your opposing teams friends who want to go against you.</p><p>We’re launching that in time for the college football season, which happens to be LSU vs. Wisconsin Badgers in late August.</p><p><em><strong>GMs:</strong></em> I know we talked briefly about how you both met, but how did you get Brett Favre on your Board of Directors?</p><p><em><strong>BW:</strong></em> Brett and I met four years ago. I was introduced through his agent, Les Cook. I went down to Mississippi to sit down with Brett and talk to him about my vision and what I saw as an opportunity and how we were focused on the athlete. Brett liked it. We spent a couple hours talking and getting to know each other. He accepted my proposal and my offer to be on the Board and to be involved as an advocate as much as he possibly cared to be, in terms of talking about Sqor and representing the brand. That was four years ago and we’ve come a long way together with that. It’s starting to get fun cause we’re starting to see, as you’re on the platform, the number of athletes that we have creating content. It’s incredible and growing, literally, weekly. It’s fun for us together to be witnessing this brand and to see this product come to life that we originally talked about.</p><p><em><strong>GMs:</strong></em> So when you met Brian a few years ago and discussed this idea, what sold you on Sqor?</p><p><em><strong>Brett Favre:</strong></em> I was at a point where my career was over and I’m part of the older generation of athletes where you used to write letters to people. Now, text messaging is part of everyday life, social media is new and expanding. By no means will I sit here and say that I was gung-ho with the social media thing because it's sort of unchartered territory for us older folk.</p><p>I really like Brian, first of all, and you’re right. Les and I get stuff that comes across the table all the time, you name it. And why they would want my involvement, I have no idea? Really, Brian is a good guy and that was the first thing that really, more than anything, sold me. I knew he was genuine, I liked his idea, but I like him even more. I have to admit; initially I thought this probably will be just like anything else. Any idea that actually comes to reality is hit or miss. You never really know. I thought this would be another passing fancy, but it hasn’t been. Brian doesn’t ask a lot of me, it’s painless, I don’t mind doing it. Whatever knowledge I can come to the table with is a bonus. I liked the idea, and I thought it had potential. I was probably more pessimistic maybe, but I’m sold on it. I think Brian had worked diligently, and I know on numerous occasions in the past couple of years he’s asked me to talk to different people he was trying to bring over to his company that would solidify his company even greater. He ended up getting those people to make this company even stronger.</p><p>I think that says a lot about Brian and the product he has. He’s driven. More important than anything, it was Brian that really sold me. He didn’t pay me an endorsement fee or anything. I plug the company and I want to see it succeed. I didn’t get my money and leave. I’ve done endorsements for different products before, and if they sell great, if not so be it. This is not one of those. I have a stake in this as well. I think it has tremendous upside, more so today than four years ago.</p><p><em><strong>GMs</strong></em>: Businesses can be financially successful and whatnot, but what you’re saying about how Brian sold you on Sqor, shows the passion you both have to make this a successful endeavour.</p><p><em><strong>BF:</strong></em> We need people like you to put the word out. I try to do my part, but it’s like anything, the more exposure the better. I think it will just continue to grow. Football is probably the one sport that is lacking with numbers (interaction). I think it’s a bigger entity to crack, but I think as players become more aware, I know during my last year of football I heard the word “Twitter”, it will. It wasn’t as big as it is now. Same thing with Sqor, I have so many people come up to me and ask me about it. Brian has sent me hats and t-shirts cause I’m a hat and t-shirt type of guy, but everyone is asking what Sqor is. I tell them if they’ve got an iPhone, download the app and play around with it. Word of mouth has been great and we need people like you to expand it.</p><p><em><strong>GMs:</strong></em> You’ve been doing contests on Sqor such as, "Who do ya think can beat me in arm wrestling?" - winner gets Sqor headphones! I’ve read some of the comments and people have quite the imagination. What’s does it feel like, despite being retired for a few years now, that you can still draw all of these great responses? It has to feel pretty good to be able to interact with the fans after all these years?</p><p><em><strong>BF: </strong></em>It’s the way it is now. If you ask the younger generation about writing letters and mailing it to you grandmother, you’d get a blank stare. The older generation has to learn to adapt or you can’t communicate! It’s just the way it is. As I retired and got a little it more removed from the game, it has been refreshing. It’s always nice to know your still loved and still hated in some circles. The comments have been very good, funny and crazy. But that’s what Sqor is about. To be able to interact with the athletes and with the fans is the biggest selling point.</p><p><em><strong>GMs:</strong></em> You just did a campaign with <a href="https://sqor.com/posts/ecde9705-74e6-4591-b325-d3b2da1aa265" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fan Experience Dinner</a>, where you can bid on a dinner with yourself, and your wife Deanna at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Biloxi. All proceeds go to <a href="http://www.favre4hope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Favre4Hope</a>.</p><p>That is really something special. I went on your site and read about all the charities you work with and the people that you reach with your kindness. That is very commendable and something you really can be proud of. Did you ever imagine that you would be able to touch so many lives?</p><p><strong><em>BF:</em></strong> I guess I was no different than most kids when I was 13 or 14 years old. I dreamed of playing pro football and pro baseball. Honestly, I never thought about the money or the fame, or the Hall of Fame or MVP’s. What I thought about was playing the game I loved and how much fun that would be.</p><p>As a retired player, what a great experience to experience my dreams and then some, along with all the other stuff that’s come along with it. There’s been a tremendous amount of good and there’s been bad, but I think the way I was raised and my wife (who I started dating when I was 13 or 14) has always grounded me. My mother was a special education teacher and my dad was a driver’s ed. teacher and also a baseball and football coach. In Mississippi you don’t make a lot of money as teachers. So combined, they had four kids and we lived modestly to say the least. I learned at a young age that you treat people with respect regardless of status. To me it’s like gravy. Some people may give back because it’s almost expected or a chore rather than the right thing to do. God put me on this earth to excel at football, gave me the talents to achieve and I took it and ran with it. I thank Him for that. He also wants to see what I can do in return with the success that I’ve had. I believe in that wholeheartedly.</p><p>We’re not immune to hardships and trouble that everyone is exposed to. My wife had breast cancer and she turned a negative into a positive and has helped so many people. My father passed away and we set up an endowment/scholarship that we’ve been able to give to a student each year at my high school to go to college. We’ve given so much back to Wisconsin and the disadvantaged children there and we were able to donate money to St. Jude Hospital in Minnesota. Let me tell you, you go to these places where you get around people like the Make A Wish kids that I’ve been with for all these years, you talk about a humbling experience. Believe me, there’s so much satisfaction giving back, and especially at this time in my life where I’m not preoccupied with playing, you look forward to these things. It’s really a special experience.</p><p><em><strong>GMs:</strong></em> Sqor athletes are showing their fans what their lives are like, on and off the field. I hear Sqor NFL ambassadors are Will Smith (Patriots), Kirk Morrison (NFL Analyst) - can you tell me more about how to become an ambassador?</p><p><em><strong>BW:</strong></em> We have athletes in all divisions, <a href="/mlb" class="inline_link">MLB</a>, MBA, retired athletes, amateurs. After you register with Sqor - Sqor will help you activate your account and set you up with ambassador</p><p><em><strong>GMs: </strong></em>Are a lot of athletes joining Sqor? Some of your rookies are: Storm Johnson (Jacksonville Jaguars) &amp; Jalen Saunders (NY Jets)</p><p><em><strong>BW:</strong></em> A lot of young smart guys are joining with great social media presence. Over 1500 professional athletes have <a href="http://www.registersqor.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">registered</a>.</p><p><em><strong>GMs:</strong></em> Honestly, this product is very different from everything out there. With over 1,500 athletes already signed-up it seems like it’s only the tip of the iceberg. The interaction between all parties is quite astonishing. Do you have athletes contacting you directly about Sqor and how they can get involved?</p><p><em><strong>BW: </strong></em>We are getting a lot of inbound inquiries. In some cases the athletes directly or they’re going to the Sqor and signing up. We get a handful of inquiries a week from agents and/or their PR/Publicists who work with athletes. The word is definitely getting out there and the organic growth is really starting to show itself.</p><p><em><strong>BF:</strong></em> I’m getting questions all the time from the general public. I’m not in the locker room everyday, or at minicamps, but I do have guys who I’ve played with and some younger generation athletes that workout here, who ask about it as well. In my opinion, Brian may have a different opinion, but I think it’s a potentially useful tool for the marketing side of the athlete. Some athletes don’t need exposure, but there are players who are leading the league in hitting or free thrown percentage, I use examples from other sports because most people know whose leading every category in football. But those guys that you don’t know anything about, but are tremendous players, this is a way for them to get their name out there. A way to get the exposure they’re not getting for whatever reason. I think, for an athlete, this is a great tool they will find out is there for them.</p>

Reds win as Leake blanks Diamondbacks

<p>The <a href="/topic/cincinnati-reds" class="inline_link">Cincinnati Reds</a> had an offensive explosion of sorts as they scored more than two runs for the first time at home in the second half as <a href="/topic/mike-leake" class="inline_link">Mike Leake</a> ended his pitching woes with 7.2 innings of shutout baseball to give the Reds a 3-0 victory on Tuesday.</p><p>Leake (8-9) had lost back-to-back <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/30465/mike-leake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">outings </a>and allowed four runs in each of his last three starts, but held Arizona (46-61) to just five hits while striking out eight. He also provided rest to a bullpen that was overworked in a 15 inning 2-1 loss on Monday. The Reds did re-call Curtis Partch to help the bullpen and take the place of Jay Bruce, who was placed on the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/cin/reds-place-jay-bruce-on-bereavement-list?ymd=20140729&amp;content_id=86873792&amp;vkey=news_cin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bereavement list</a> after the passing of his grandfather. Bruce will most likely return on Friday in Miami.</p><p>Leake got offensive help right away from Billy Hamilton who led off the first with a double and then scored on an RBI single by <a href="/topic/todd-frazier" class="inline_link">Todd Frazier</a>. Unlike the day before, the Reds (53-53) added on and did so quickly in the second when Donald Lutz singled then moved to second on a wild pitch by Trevor Cahill (1-8). Zack Cozart followed with a single of his own before Leake helped his own cause with an RBI base hit.</p><p>He was able to secure the lead despite allowing the Diamondbacks to get a runner to third with one out. The Reds would add an insurance run in the sixth when Frazier singled, stole second, and then scored on an RBI single by <a href="/topic/brayan-pena" class="inline_link">Brayan Pena</a>. Since the All-Star Break, Pena has driven in four of the Reds 18 runs and has hit safely in his last five games and six of the last seven.</p><p>That would be it for Cahill as the Reds were shutdown by Bo Schutlz, who was called up Tuesday to help the Arizona bullpen. Leake once again escaped a runner on third with one out as he got pinch hitter David Peralta to line out to center and end the seventh. He would not make it through the eighth as he hit Miguel Montero with two outs after striking out Aaron Hill and Paul Goldschmidt. Jonathan Broxton came on with two on and two out to face Mark Trumbo, who just missed tying the game, but instead flew out to Hamilton on the warning track.</p><p>Aroldis Chapman came on in the ninth for his 23rd save and did so by striking out Didi Gregorious to extend his consecutive relief appearances with a least one K to 45. The two teams will play an afternoon matinee with first pitch set for 12:35 on Wednesday. Alfredo Simon (12-5) looks his first win since the break and will be opposed by Wade Miley (6-7).</p>

‘Sons of Anarchy’ season 7 casting news: Adds ‘Cosby’ kid Malcolm-Jamal Warner
";i:4;s:15:"
July 24, 2014
";i:5;s:2108:"
<p>One thing “<a href="/topic/sons-of-anarchy" class="inline_link">Sons of Anarchy</a>” isn’t shy about doing is adding new characters and cast to the show. As season 7 is already filming, news that yet another character has been added seems a little surprising, especially given this is the last season for the hugely popular motorcycle club drama. According to a report on Movie Pilot today, the latest member of the cast is former ‘Cosby’ kid, Malcolm-Jamal Warner.</p><p>Warner is set play a character named “Sticky.” Don’t you just love some of the names? He is going to be the right-hand man of T.O. Cross (Michael Beach), the president of the Grim Bastards Motorcycle Club. Cross started out as a friend of Clay’s but when we last saw him in season 5, he and Jax were not on the best terms. Cross was protecting the guy who beat Opie to death in the Stockton prison. The character of Cross will be back this season but in just what capacity is not yet known.</p><p>Other than being Cross’s go-to guy, the character of Sticky is also a mystery. Seeing Theo as a leather-clad biker badass may be a shock for some people but Warner has stayed busy in industry since leaving “<a href="/topic/the-cosby-show-1" class="inline_link">The Cosby Show</a>” when it ended in 1992 after a 7 year run. In addition to dozens of appearances on numerous television shows, Warner has also starred in a couple other series. He starred in “Malcom &amp; Eddie” from 1996 to 2000 and in “Jeremiah” from 2002 to 2004. He’s also done some occasional directing.</p><p>Also joining the cast for the seventh and final season of “Sons of Anarchy” are Marilyn Manson and Courtney Love. Manson will play Ron Tully, a powerful and well-connected inmate in prison with Jax. Love plays the preschool teacher taking care of Abel, Jax’s oldest son.</p><p>Season 7 of "<a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/soa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sons of Anarchy</a>" premieres on September 9 on FX. The season premiere and finale will be followed by a live panel show, called "Anarchy Afterword."</p>

INSP Network thrives as a family friendly destination
";i:4;s:15:"
July 24, 2014
";i:5;s:6550:"
<p>Long known as a ‘preach and teach’ channel, the television network INSP is taking steps to reinvent itself as a family-friendly network with the intent of creating ‘lunge free’ viewing using a mixture of acquired and original content.</p><p>INSP, formerly known as The Inspiration Network, began in 1990 as a not-for-profit ministry focused network. In October 2010, the network was launched as a commercial supported family entertainment network.</p><p>Under the banner of the motto “Welcome Home,” INSP currently features classic dramas such as “The Waltons,” “<a href="/topic/matlock" class="inline_link">Matlock</a>," "JAG," and “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,” among other acquired programming.</p><p>John Roos, Senior Vice President of Communications and Research at INSP, explains the thought process behind the comprehensive shift in the channel's on-air content, saying, “Our research supports the theory that viewers want a safe place, a refuge, a place on the dial morning, noon and night, that they can go to, a place where they’re not insulted with poor quality shows and questionable material in commercials.”</p><p>Chief Executive Officer of INSP, Dale Ardizzone, further clarifies the notion, breaking it down a bit into simpler, yet very defined, terms, saying, “We live by the theory that you should never have to lunge for the remote, during either a program or a commercial, and we strictly adhere to that as there are other networks that may have family-friendly programming but then the commercial comes on and you’re not comfortable watching it with your kids. We didn’t coin the phrase ‘lunge free’ from out of nowhere, it developed naturally as we had discussions about the direction that we wanted to take. Now that’s we strive to be at all times.”</p><p>The adoption of this shift in their overall presentation has yielded positive results for the network thus far.</p><p>“The response to everything we’re doing has been very positive,” confirms Roos. “We’ve had huge growth in tune-in and the number of minutes that people stay with the network. All of that reaffirms for us that we’re onto something.”</p><p>The next major step for INSP is expanding their programming schedule.</p><p>As a first foray into original content, the network created a short form series called “<a href="/topic/moments" class="inline_link">Moments</a>.”</p><p>“These are content pieces, two to three minutes long, that feature inspiration stories,” explains Melissa Prince, Director of Communications at INSP. “In our transition to an entertainment network from the more religious-based network that we’ve been in the past, we didn’t want to abandon that ‘inspiration factor’ that people are still looking for, so we’re using these as sort of a bridge from what we were to what we’re becoming. These pieces are interspersed throughout our programming using time that we could sell to advertisers but that we chosen to use this way instead because we feel these pieces are an important part of the message that we want to convey about our network.”</p><p>There are over 100 of the interstitials that, in addition to airing on the network, are also available on the website <a href="http://moments.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Moments.org.</a></p><p>Building on the success of “Moments,” Roos says that there’s plenty more programming in the works at INSP. “We’ve been developing original content for a bit now and we’re getting ready to announce our first wave of new material very soon. This will include some shorter form documentary-type shows and some scripted pieces as well.”</p><p>But, as with all expansion, there may be some growing pains along the way and this fact isn't lost on the leaders at INSP as they’re well aware that any changes have the potential to upset viewers who’ve already become attached to the network’s current fare.</p><p>“One of the downsides is that many people in our existing audience have a sense of ownership,” Roos explains, “They have this passion for certain things. The degree to which they love us is fantastic, but they love us so much that they don’t want us to change, so when we add a program  or move something we get phone calls and emails with people saying, ‘what’re you doing to my network? I want my show when I want it. I build my day around it.’ So there’s a fine balance that we have to maintain with adding new things while still staying with the things that our viewers want to see. That’s a challenge at times, but one that we gladly welcome.”</p><p>Given this kind of commitment by viewers, Roos, Ardizzone and Prince are well aware that changing the mindset about a television network is not an easy or quick task and that moving the network in a new direction will take a significant amount of time.</p><p>“There are hundreds of ways to re-brand a channel, but at the end of the day, whether you’re changing your programming or changing your name, it’s turning a barge not turning a canoe,” says Ardizzone, “You have to commit to the process and you have to be patient. We’re clearly committed, we're obviously moving forward and we're definitely being patient.”</p><p>To this Prince adds, “It’s a crawling, then walking, then running type of thing in our development process. Right now, we’ve started with ‘Moments,’ we’re acquiring more content, and we’re actively working on original material, so we really feel like we’re progressing at a very good pace right now.”</p><p>Having said all of this about their work, Roos mostly wants viewers to know that, “The network is certainly not what it was ten years ago, it’s not even what it was just a few years ago and even though there are parts of the day where we have religious programming, the overall feel and flavor is very different now. We know we still have a lot of work to do but it helps to know that given what we’ve seen from the audience so far, we’re on the right path. So, if people are truly looking for a 'lunge free' environment, they should definitely give us a try. We promise that we'll stick to that motto and provide programming, including ads, that the whole family can watch together."</p><p><em>Announcements about new programming on INSP will be made here as they become available.</em></p><p><em><strong>INSP is available on most cable and satellite systems.

Pawn Star $2 Million plaza expansion: Rick Harrison unveils big plan

<p>A <a href="http://www.newser.com/article/922e6b8d174a4ec191b5dec57754d372/star-of-pawn-stars-tv-show-plans-shopping-plaza-near-famous-las-vegas-shop-to-develop-area.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pawn Star $2 million plaza</a> could soon take over downtown Las Vegas. Rick Harrison, one of the owners of Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop, wants to build a shopping center near his downtown Las Vegas pawnshop.  He knows exactly how he wants it to look too. The reality star has now shared his vision for the downtown Las Vegas location with the city, and it will be reviewed in September. Newser shared the latest on this planned expansion on July 28.</p><p>Rick Harrison wants to change the look of downtown Las Vegas. The area is home to the famous Fremont Street Experience, but downtown Las Vegas is not pretty once you get away from the shiny lights of the casinos. Near his pawnshop, he has an out of business tattoo parlor and two bail bonds offices. His planned shopping plaza will take over the property where the tattoo shop rests currently. His next plan is to buy the land where the bail bond's offices sit for another expansion.</p><p>Theo Spyer, a general manager at the pawnshop, spoke out about Harrison's plans and vision for the development. He said the following:</p><p>"We have always tried to improve our customer experience while waiting in line. Now we intend to take it to the next level. We are currently working on a line system that will enable the fans to patronize Pawn Star Plaza without losing their position in line. It was more of the look, flexibility, ease of construction and simplicity of design that created Rick's vision for the space."</p><p>The plaza would take on the look of a Rubik's Cube. The center would consist of 22 modular cubes. This will house six restaurants and 16 stores, according to Harrison. He is hoping to start work on the $2 million dollar project by the start of the year. He just needs to have the city's approval. He is not asking for any money for the plaza. He will fund it entirely himself. He said the following about the project, according to <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/pawn-stars-star-proposes-vegas-plaza" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Las Vegas Review Journal</a>:</p><p>"The city’s always been pretty decent to me. I really want to see this part of town do great."</p><p>He also joked that about the safety of the structure by saying that if a nuclear war ever came to Las Vegas, he would go straight to the shopping plaza. Harrison's pawnshop has already helped rejuvenate the downtown area of the city. He purchased the first piece of land there back in 1992 for $250,000. He bought the parking lot parcel in 1994 for another $250,000. The land under the tattoo parlor was purchased for $1.1 million in 2005.  </p><p>"Pawn Stars" has become a huge hit for The History Channel, and the pawn business is good for Rick Harrison. His shop is currently open 24 hours a day, and it is featured on a second reality series as well. Harrison has big dreams for the area, and he wants to turn things around for downtown Las Vegas. This first shopping plaza could soon be joined by a second, but he first needs to buy the remaining land. If successful, Harrison would take over the 700 block of Las Vegas Boulevard South. Harrison will find out if he has the go ahead for the project this fall.</p>

<p><a href="/topic/maksim-chmerkovskiy" class="inline_link">Maksim Chmerkovskiy</a> and <a href="/topic/meryl-davis" class="inline_link">Meryl Davis</a> won the mirror ball trophy last night and have been heating things up on the dance floor.

Online</a> shared a few things that the couple had to say about their world on and off the dance floor.</p><p>It is obvious these two have chemistry. Maks said that he proposed to Meryl just five minutes after meeting her but she hasn't answered yet. She replied that she is stubborn. Obviously it wasn't a real proposal but fans hope to hear that they are a couple.</p><p>Maks said that he finally feels like he has completed his goal by winning. He said that she is incredible to be around and he plans to spend more time with her. They will be together a lot over the next few days but aren't really sharing what will happen after that with these two.</p><p><a href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/05/21/maksim-chmerkovskiy-meryl-davis-connection-dwts-dating-gma/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hollywood Life</a> shared how Maks said that they had chemistry right away. They were on "Good Morning America" this morning talking about it all. Things went great for these two on the show and they even won it all. It was an amazing season according to Meryl Davis. Maks said that this was the right time for him to win and it felt perfect this season.</p><p>They were asked if there was more to it than just friends on "GMA" but they aren't admitting much. They do have an incredible connection and he said they come from totally different planets. He said you blink and its over but now the 10 weeks is over for these two. Maks didn't share if he will be back next season or not.</p><p>Viewers will just have to wait and see what Meryl Davis and Maksim Chmerkovskiy do in the future. Neither one of them is admitting they are more than friends, but it looks like it could be more. Now that they will not be together every single day they will have to see what happens. </p>

Blake Shelton tarnishes NBC broadcast, The Voice's reputation

<p>On April 26, 2014, this column <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/america-s-got-talent-breaks-the-trend-of-reality-tv-competitions">wrote</a> about the fallacies of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/americas-got-talent?__source=Reso_AGT_SMR_Brand_Exact_Google&amp;k_clickid=2e4a6ee0-01f4-5de9-e36c-00007b2ac264&amp;k_prof=6&amp;k_affcode=15251&amp;sky=america%27s%20got%20talent" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">America's Got Talent</a>, now entering its 9th season, particularly in relation to its judges and how they compare to the otherwise responsible and invested coaches on <a href="http://www.nbc.com/the-voice" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Voice</a>.</p><p>During the April 29, 2014 broadcast of <a href="/topic/the-voice" class="inline_link">The Voice</a>, however, those preconceptions about The Voice were shattered.</p><p>This week's broadcast should have been known as one of the strongest competitions ever; a live performance round marked by solid performances across the board and a results show which not only saw one of their top contenders, Bria Kelly, eliminated early, but ultimately eliminated in favor of Kat Perkins, whom Kelly had been declared the winner over when they competed head to head during the knockout rounds.</p><p>Instead, all of the buzz is over coach <a href="/topic/blake-shelton" class="inline_link">Blake Shelton</a>, who did something so spiteful and so childish that even the combined hostility of American Idol's Nicki Minaj and the immaturity of America's Got Talent's Howie Mandel does not compare.</p><p>Midway through the broadcast, Shelton announced via <a href="https://twitter.com/blakeshelton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">his Twitter account</a> that he had rival coach <a href="/topic/adam-levine" class="inline_link">Adam Levine</a>'s personal cell phone number, which he joked about releasing.</p><p>Which was not all that funny to begin with, and even less so when he actually went ahead and did it:</p><p>HEY EVERYONE!!! Here it is: (XXX) XXX-XXXX &lt;-- @adamlevine's CELL NUMBER! Think I'm kidding? Try calling it!! B****!!!</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Levine's cell phone was described as ringing off the hook. Shelton's tweet was also reportedly retweeted over thirty thousand times.</p><p>Shelton apologized and claimed to be so sorry that he began taking Levine's calls for him. That said, he was not sorry enough to delete the tweet from his account.</p><p>This is the very sort of childish feuding by American Idol judges which this column credited with its eventual fall from grace. It is a disservice to NBC, and even more to the singers, many of whom have their entire careers in entertainment hanging in the balance.</p><p>Levine promised revenge, but were he to ask for advice, this column's recommendation would be to avoid stooping to Shelton's level. The better course of action would be to put as much distance between Shelton and himself as possible; to refuse to coach any more seasons in which Shelton is also present and to refuse to take part in any further collaborations with him in the future.</p><p>With this action, Shelton has indicated that a childish feud is now more important to him than the integrity of The Voice, and by extension, the future of the artists he is supposed to be coaching. That kind of behavior does not belong anywhere, and the best way Levine could demonstrate such immediately is by refusing to have anything to do with it.</p>

";i:5;s:5264:"
<p>As the end of the summer spectacular draw closer, <a href="/topic/wwe" class="inline_link">WWE</a> is bringing the big-time action each and every single week. On the evening of July 28, 2014, <a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2014-07-28/wwe-raw-results-26526502" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WWE "Monday Night Raw"</a> took place and there was a lot that needed to be taken care of and settled. John Cena was ready to respond to Paul Heyman and Brock Lesnar while Stephanie McMahon invited Brie Bella back to the ring.</p><p>If you haven't yet seen the show and don't want to know the results, then it's best if you stop reading now.</p><p>~ John Cena started off the show and talked for a really long time about Brock Lesnar and how he will face off with him at "SumemrSlam." He says that WWE could be in trouble if Lesnar got the title and he's got to be the one to stop him.</p><p>Paul Heyman came out and said that Cena will be conquered by Lesnar. Cena then insulted Heyman, but thaat brought out Cesaro to defend his old manager and set up a match.</p><p>~ Cena defeated Cesaro with a second-rope Attitude Adjustment in a really good opening match. Both men gave it their all for the opening match of a "Raw," and it was well worth all the talking to start the night off.</p><p><strong>SEE: <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/tna-impact-wrestling-cancelled-by-spiketv-contract-up-october">TNA 'Impact Wrestling' cancelled by SpikeTV - Contract up in October</a></strong></p><p>~ Backstage, Stephanie McMcmahon told Triple H that she can't get over going to prison last week. Randy Orton came in and complained about getting a title shot and Trips brought up Roman Reigns. Orton said he wanted Reigns but Trips said Reigns was facing Kane tonight.</p><p>Orton said he also had problems with Kane and Triple H.</p><p>~ Paige hit the ring and said she still considers AJ Lee her best friend and her emotions got the best of her last week. AJ came to the ring and they talked a bit before she attacked Paige and tossed her outside the ring.</p><p>~ Triple H and Stephanie came out to the ring and talked more about Steph going to jail before she invited Brie Bella out to the ring. Chris Jericho came out and ran down Stephanie like he did so many years ago. Triple H said he should really focus on Bray Wyatt, but he won't get him until "SummerSlam."</p><p>That was when Seth Rollins ran out and attacked Jericho with the MITB briefcase. Trips said that was Jericho's opponent for the evening.</p><p>~ The Usos and Dolph Ziggler defeated Rybaxel and The Miz when Ziggler hit the ZigZag on Ryback for the win. It was a good six-man tag with a lot of action, and it included the group of Xavier Woods, Big E, and Kofi Kingston watching from a distance.</p><p>~ Bo Dallas beat R-Truth with a quick roll-up and then attacked him after the match.</p><p>~ Rusev and Lana came to the ring and she said the American flag was not a faded symbol of what was once a great nation. She tore down President Obama and former President Bush before Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter came to the ring. They spoke of freedom and got the crowd to chant "We The People."</p><p>Swagger hit the ring, but Rusev got the upper-hand and tried to lock in the Accolade, but Swagger reversed it and attempted the Patriot Lock before Rusev finally retreats.</p><p>~ Adam Rose defeated Damien Sandow, who was dressed in a spacesuit. Yep.</p><p>~ Roman Reigns was walking to the ring, but he was attacked by Orton. Reigns got the upper-hand but then hit the ring and started taking down Kane. Orton got into the ring and took a Superman Punch, but Reigns got chokeslammed by Kane, who then left.</p><p>Orton started beating down Reigns and just destroyed him. It ended with Orton taking the announcer's table apart and then nailing Reigns with an RKO on it. After it didn't break, Orton hit a second one on it.</p><p>~ Diego defeated Fandango after he was distracted by Layla and Summer Rae.</p><p>~ Natalya and Naomi defeated Alicia Fox and Cameron in a diva's tag team match.</p><p>~ Chris Jericho defeated Seth Rollins by disqualification. The match was actually going really good and it got to Jericho nailing a mid-air Codebreaker on Rollins when the lights went out. As the lights came back up, the Wyatts were in the ring and destroyed Jericho.</p><p>After beating Jericho, Bray Wyatt nailed him with Sister Abigail and all three of the family members stared down at a fallen Y2J.</p><p>~ Stephanie McMahon came out to the ring again and finally gets Brie Bella to come out to the ring. Steph says she will treat Nikki fairly and give her a raise, but Brie has some demands as well. Brie wants her job back, but Steph says no unless the charges are all dropped.</p><p>Brie says she will drop the charges as long as...Stephanie accepts a match against her at "SummerSlam." Steph at first says she hasn't competed in 10 years and can't do it, but needs to do it so the charges will be dropped.</p><p>After they both agree to the match, Steph slaps Brie so hard that she knocks her off the apron and tells her she will "make Brie her b*tch." Brie slides back in the ring and tackles Steph and begins punching her until Trips and other agents pull them apart to end the show.</p>

TNA 'Impact Wrestling' cancelled by SpikeTV: Contract up in October
";i:4;s:15:"
July 27, 2014
";i:5;s:2005:"
<p>In some news that could turn the wrestling world upside-down, the number two company behind <a href="/topic/wwe" class="inline_link">WWE</a> may soon be without a TV home. <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/07/27/impact-wrestling-cancelled-spike-tv-tna/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TMZ</a> reported on July 28, 2014, that "Impact Wrestling" has indeed been cancelled by SpikeTV as the company's contract will not be renewed.</p><p>While this may be news to everyone else, it doesn't appear to be brand new information to those behind TNA's focus show "Impact Wrestling."</p><p>It appears as if TNA President Dixie Carter had been informed of this information late last week. The day after it was broken to her, she broke the news to the rest of those at the top of the chain in TNA. <a href="http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/496861-future-of-impact-wrestling-on-spiketv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WrestleZone</a> reported that Carter had a meeting early on Sunday to regard the company's future.</p><p>The meeting was said to be held at the company's Nashville headquarters, but no-one from SpikeTV was said to be there. This meeting was supposedly between just those involved with TNA.</p><p>As of now, the current deal for TNA's "Impact Wrestling" runs through sometime in October, but having now cancelled the show, there's no telling if it will even run that long.</p><p>SpikeTV has not yet officially announced the cancellation of "Impact Wrestling." They also haven't said anything about when the last show will air either. It's been airing on SpikeTV since it's debut back in october of 2005.</p><p>Rumors persisted that both sides were trying to come to some kind of agreement, but that doesn't appear to be the case. As of this time, it truly appears as if "Impact Wrestling" has been cancelled, and it's days on SpikeTV is extremely numbered.</p><p>There is no telling where the company would try to go from here and land a television deal, but something needs to be done quickly.</p>

WWE news: Bo Dallas talks about fighting his brother Bray Wyatt
";i:4;s:15:"
July 28, 2014
";i:5;s:2355:"
<p>It is rare that second generation wrestling siblings break into the <a href="/topic/wwe" class="inline_link">WWE</a> at the same time, yet never acknowledge in storylines that they are related. That is exactly what happened when <a href="/topic/bray-wyatt" class="inline_link">Bray Wyatt</a> entered the WWE as one of the most interesting villains in recent memory and then his brother <a href="/topic/bo-dallas" class="inline_link">Bo Dallas</a> showed up as an arrogant heel as different from his brother as any character. <a href="http://www.prowrestlingscoops.com/wwe/wwe-news/bo-dallas-discusses-his-brother-bray-wyatt-nxt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">According to PWS on Monday</a>, Dallas said that the day might come where the two brothers finally fight in the ring.</p><p>Bray Wyatt showed up in the WWE as an outsider, a rebel who wanted to burn the WWE to the ground and reform it in his own image. He attacked men like Daniel Bryan and John Cena and is now in a feud with Chris Jericho, three men who are shining stars in the WWE. Bray Wyatt is anti-establishment and preaches the darkness in the world.</p><p>Bo Dallas showed up in the WWE after holding the <a href="/topic/nxt" class="inline_link">NXT</a> title longer than anyone in the history of the company. He is a character that is slightly based on that of Tim Tebow, a shining light in the world who preaches positivity to such an extent that the fans hate him for it. He is a good mix of the Right to Censor group and Honky Tonk Man when it comes to his arrogance dealing with fans and his opponents.</p><p>In the interview with Bo Dallas, he said that both he and Bray Wyatt came into the WWE with one thought in mind. They wanted to live their characters to make them as good as they could. They chose to refuse to become molds of their father Mike “IRS” Rotundo or their uncles in the Windham family. They wanted to become WWE originals and have done a great job at it.</p><p>As far as Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas one day meeting in the ring, Dallas said that Wyatt is a perfect heel in the WWE right now and Dallas has his own agenda. <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/mma-disputed/2014/07/one-on-one-bo-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">He said he thinks</a> that one day the two characters will cross paths, but how that happens will be anyone’s guess. </p>

WWE news: Nikki Bella suffers wardrobe malfunction during Monday Night Raw
";i:4;s:15:"
July 23, 2014
";i:5;s:3224:"
<p>According to a July 22 <a href="http://www.sportsworldnews.com/articles/16014/20140722/nikki-bella-wardrobe-malfunction-photo-wwe-diva-has-minor-slip-on-monday-night-raw-video.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">report from</a> Sports World News, <a href="/topic/wwe" class="inline_link">WWE</a> Divas superstar <a href="/topic/nikki-bella" class="inline_link">Nikki Bella</a> suffered a <a href="/topic/wardrobe-malfunction" class="inline_link">wardrobe malfunction</a> during her match on <em><a href="/topic/monday-night-raw" class="inline_link">Monday Night Raw</a></em>, which aired live on the USA Network. Bella, 30, was competing against Alicia Fox, Eva Marie, Cameron and Rosa Mendes in a four-on-one handicap match, when the wardrobe malfunction occurred. It's not clear exactly what caused the wardrobe malfunction, but it was likely due to a kick or punch from one of the WWE Divas that Bella was up against.</p><p>Bella's wardrobe malfunction appears to have been completely accidental and not part of the script. Oddly enough, Bella's sister, Brie, suffered a wardrobe malfunction <a href="http://www.pwmania.com/photos-of-brie-bella-nip-slip-wwe-raw-7-22-13" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on a</a> televised show, this time last year. If there's any good that came of the situation, its that Bella's wardrobe malfunction occurred late enough that most younger pro wrestling fans were likely asleep by that point in the episode. Additionally, she was exposed for just seconds, before WWE's camera crew realized what had happened and cut away.</p><p>Did Bella's wardrobe malfunction <a href="http://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe-raw/2014/7/21/5924941/nikki-bella-nipple-slip-raw-wwe-stephanie-mcmahon-brie-bella-confrontation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">take away</a> from an intriguing segment that included a collision between <a href="/topic/brie-bella" class="inline_link">Brie Bella</a> and Stephanie McMahon? Yes and no. Fans were momentarily distracted by Bella's exposed body, but the feud between Brie and McMahon immediately brought the fans' attention back to where it belonged. With Brie Bella expected to wrestle McMahon next month at <em>SummerSlam</em>, the WWE used <em>Monday Night Raw</em> as a vehicle to hype the feud.</p><p>Perhaps the WWE can learn something from Bella's wardrobe malfunction. To prevent future situations like this from occurring, the WWE could possibly create new uniforms for the WWE Divas to wear. Since Bella and the other WWE Divas are scripted to wear revealing, form-fitting costumes, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that they would suffer wardrobe malfunctions from time to time. This takes away from the hard work, skills and athleticism of the female athletes.</p><p>This is a time when WWE fans should be talking about Bella's elite skills inside the ring, and the budding feud between Brie Bella and Stephanie McMahon. Instead, WWE Universe is buzzing about wardrobe malfunctions. These incidents are bad for the WWE Divas division, and not good for the WWE's business overall. Time will tell how the situation plays out in the future, but the hope is that the WWE will create uniforms that can hold up to the grind of a pro wrestling match.</p>

Gennady "GGG" Golovkin: Declares War On Miguel Cotto
";i:4;s:15:"
July 28, 2014
";i:5;s:7145:"
<p><em>"<a href="http://www.hbo.com/boixng" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miguel Cotto</a>. 100%, I respect him, I respect his style. This is the biggest fight for everybody. For TV, for my fans, for everybody. For <a href="/topic/boxing" class="inline_link">boxing</a>."</em></p><p><a href="http://www.hbo.com/boxing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gennady "GGG" Golovkin</a>, when asked who he wanted next by HBO's Max Kellerman, after mugging <a href="http://www.hbo.com/boxing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Geale</a> in 3 rounds.</p><p>Um... That's sooooo not good.</p><p>See, the thing that was most impressive about Golovkin's one-punch decimation of Geale (we'll ignore the left-handed slap on the back of Geale's head on his way down), is that it came <em>after</em> he was struck by a full impact shot from Geale, and <em>while</em> he was delivering the knockout punch.</p><p>Geale's mind went into another zipcode, and his legs instantly turned into al dente pasta from a less than full impact flush right hand. Only someone truly great can do this to a world-class fighter. This is like Tom Brady completing a deep throw touchdown pass while being nailed by a Seattle Seahawk (alright I'm a Patriots fan I couldn't resist).</p><p>But you get my point. </p><p>When I offered the forecast of <a href="/topic/miguel-cotto" class="inline_link">Miguel Cotto</a> vs. <a href="http://www.hbo.com/boxing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sergio Martinez</a> right before it happened (you can see that <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/miguel-cotto-vs-sergio-martinez-bloody-spanish-beef">here</a> if you like, I was like... <em>really</em> accurate) I offered that sometimes life's a bitch and then it decides to have puppies.</p><p>I was metaphorically referring to Sergio Martinez, who barked about his bite right up until he was bitten into retreat by a real dog in Cotto. No disrespect to Martinez, but I never felt he was a top 10 pound for pound best fighter in the world - ever - and that Cotto would be a stylistic nightmare for him.</p><p>Why he decided to continue with his career is anyone's guess, all he's going to have is more bad dreams.</p><p>I don't think Cotto would toss n' turn over Golovkin, but that doesn't make him any less of a nightmare. He is - and always has been, a very proud and supremely confident fighter who works very hard in one of the most demanding trades in the world. His has been the story of a renaissance, for he was all but considered dead after extending <a href="http://www.showtime.com/boxing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Floyd Mayweather</a> in a tough decision loss (while wearing the gloves <a href="http://www.showtime.com/boxing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marcos Maidana </a><em>was not</em> allowed to use I might add); then serving as almost cannon fodder in single-handedly marking the arrival of <a href="http://www.showtime.com/boxing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Austin Trout</a>.  </p><p>In his two fights "back" under Freddie Roach, Cotto has looked like the monster he was at 140lbs in destroying Delvin Rodriguez at 154, and then of course his sadistic dismissal of Martinez to capture the RING and WBC lineal middleweight titles in June. But how would all of this translate in a fight with Golovkin, who isn't anything like Rodriguez or Martinez, or really <em>anything</em> he's ever seen before. Cotto has never been one to back down from a challenge and arguably boasts the most impressive resume in all of boxing. But is he willing to accept Golovkin's challenge?</p><p>Or the better question might be,<em> should he? </em></p><p><strong>GENNADY "GGG" GOLOVKIN VS. MIGUEL COTTO</strong></p><p>It makes the most sense and should be relatively easy to make. Both fight on HBO, and from a promotional stand point its a fight that's friendly to make. Cotto has always been a sensation and box office bonanza at Madison Square Garden, so pairing him with Golovkin at MSG (where the Kazakhstan terror has been a success in his own right) is<em> this close</em> to a no-brainer.</p><p>Golovkin's rather direct (and politically correct) declaration of war was made right in front of Cotto's trainer Freddie Roach, who sat ringside to scout "GGG" himself. I don't yet know how Freddie assessed what he saw, but he undoubtedly knows he'd have to structure Miguel in a way far beyond what he already has.    </p><p>What Roach has been able to do is successfully remind Cotto of who he was at his best. He's rid him of the over-thinking tendency he developed which lead to ring apprehension, and got him to close space while operating behind a textbook blend of skills. His best punch, the left hook, is once again one of boxing's most feared weapons, and his debilitating body attack has been fully restored. Cotto would be either very competitive with or defeat any 154lb champion there is (Mayweather would have serious difficulty beating this Cotto) and scare the hell out of any elite middleweight.</p><p>He is also a much better fighter than Daniel Geale and would offer Golovkin much more resistance...</p><p>Geale, with his side-to-side, in and out frenzied nature - found out that going "in" on Golovkin gets you out of a fight rather quickly. Cotto's more advanced footwork and more polished ring movement; to go along with his high guard, compact shoulders and better overall game, would advance Golovkin with the best offensive arsenal that the Kazakhstan product has probably ever seen. Cotto would believe in himself right up to the point where he started being effected by what I think is Golovkin's most punishing weapon of them all: his thunderous jab.</p><p>Golovkin turns, relaxes his right shoulder, and thrusts his entire body weight into the jab with his feet firmly planted.</p><p>It alone would start immediately rearranging Miguel's features, make him fallback, and get him to start fighting in retreat. A fairly competitive bout for maybe 2 or 3 rounds would start turning into a comprehensive beating of sorts. Everything Golovkin throws is heavy- whether inside at close range or from a distance. Cotto would be rendered cut, swollen, bruised, battered, and basically beaten the hell out of.</p><p>The best version of Miguel Cotto I've ever seen was against <a href="http://www.mp8.ph" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manny Pacquiao</a> in 2009. The 2nd best version I'd see would be against Golovkin. Pacquiao overwhelmed Cotto with his blinding speed and variety. Golovkin would run roughshod over him with an almost bionic aggression, subjecting him to the ugliest beating he's never dreamed of.    </p><p>Miguel is near the zenith of his career and has a superfight with <a href="http://www.goldenboy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Saul Canelo Alvarez</a> directly in front of him if that fight can be negotiated successfully. As lucrative as a fight with Golovkin is, one with Alvarez is far more lucrative - and safer. But the bottom line is this: Gennady "GGG" Golovkin would pound a very brave Miguel Cotto into complete submission via brutal 7th round TKO.</p><p>If I was Cotto, I'd seek a peace treaty agreement.</p>

KISS celebrates its 40th anniversary with a summer tour ‘victory lap’
";i:4;s:15:"

<p>In celebration of its 40th anniversary, the legendary American rock band <a href="http://kissonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KISS</a> is in the midst of a summer tour that lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist <a href="/topic/paul-stanley" class="inline_link">Paul Stanley</a> calls “a victory lap.”</p><p>“To be able to have the privilege of going out on stage and performing 40 years on is incredible,” Stanley said in a recent press teleconference. “This is a vindication and a huge celebration for us and our fans.”</p><p>On the tour, which stops Sunday, August 3 at Camden, New Jersey’s Susquehanna Bank Center, Stanley and his band mates – <a href="/topic/gene-simmons" class="inline_link">Gene Simmons</a> (lead vocals and bass), Eric Singer (drums and vocals), and Tommy Thayer (lead guitar and vocals) – are being joined by special guests <a href="http://www.defleppard.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Def Leppard</a>.  The Dead Daisies open the 7 p.m. Susquehanna Bank Center show. Tickets are available at <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/search?tm_link=tm_homeA_header_search&amp;user_input=&amp;q=kiss" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ticketmaster.com</a>.</p><p>It's been a good year for Stanley and <a href="/topic/kiss" class="inline_link">KISS</a>. On April 8, Stanley's autobiography, “Face the Music: A Life Exposed,” was released to positive reviews. It landed at No. 2 on the New York Times "Hardcover Nonfiction" best sellers list. Later that week, KISS finally received its long overdue induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>In May the band released “KISS 40,” a two-disc retrospective album. On Aug. 12, “4th and Loud,” a new television series documenting Stanley and Simmons’ foray into Arena League Football as co-owners of the LA KISS premieres on AMC. A few weeks ago, KISS confirmed its first Las Vegas residency. “KISS Rocks Vegas” will see the band perform nine shows at The Joint inside the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino between November 5th and 23rd.</p><p>If all that weren't enough, reviews of the current North American tour with <a href="/topic/def-leppard" class="inline_link">Def Leppard</a> (which wraps up in Houston, Texas on August 31) have ranged from positive to positively glowing. Stanley makes it clear that even after 40 years, KISS is not about to rest on its laurels.</p><p>“Going out on this 40th anniversary tour is a way for us to restate who we are, put our 8-inch heels firmly back on the ground, and let people know that the legend lives – that everything they've heard remains true,” he says. “This is a band unlike any other band, and you only have to come see us to know it.”</p><p>The current tour is the first time fans in the U.S. will get to see the unique and interactive “spider stage” that Stanley designed for last year’s European tour in support of the band’s 2012 “Monster” album. Fans can also expect all of the bells and whistles that are KISS’s trademark – levitating platforms, pyro, explosions, fire breathing, and band members flying over the audience.</p><p>But Stanley points out that all of the visual effects would mean little if KISS wasn't first and foremost musically a great band.</p><p>“Ultimately it's got to be great music,” he says. “Anybody can set off bombs and fireworks and all the rest. Any band with money can do a KISS show, but no other band can be KISS. We are a rock band and have always been a rock band. Our roots are in bands that we loved growing up. We enhanced it with a great show, but ultimately nobody will buy – for decades – music that isn't good. The songs have stood the test of time.”</p><p>Fans can expect to hear classics like “Shout It Out Loud,” “Deuce,” “Love Gun,” “Detroit Rock City,” “Black Diamond,” “Lick It Up,” and of course, “Rock and Roll All Night.” Sometimes criticized for a stagnant set list, the band has been switching songs in and out more often on this tour than in the past. Rarely heard songs like “King of the Nighttime World,” “Makin' Love,” “War Machine,” and “Hide Your Heart” have been performed over the past few weeks.</p><p>Stanley says Def Leppard is a perfect fit as an opening act for KISS.</p><p>“We've always tried to have great bands on tour with us. Now more than ever, we want to make sure that people get their money’s worth,” he said. “To bring Def Leppard along means that everybody gets to hear a huge catalog of songs that were all hits and that all mean something to them. Def Leppard is just a great band and it's a great way to spend an evening during the summer.”</p><p>As it has in the past, KISS is once again supporting our military on the current tour. KISS and Def Leppard have hired two veterans as roadies for the tour, and are donating a portion of the proceeds from the tour to the Wounded Warrior Project, an organization that assists injured service members.</p><p>“We have been very vocal over the years about our obligation to our troops and to the people who serve voluntarily and put themselves in harm’s way so that we can live in a free society,” Stanley says. “I can't say enough about the people who serve on our behalf. What we do wouldn't be possible without what they do. I love being on stage and letting people know that there's nothing corny about patriotism; there's nothing corny about celebrating this great country.”</p><p>There was a time when being a KISS fan could get you ridiculed by, ostracized from, or in a fight with other music fans. Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave guitarist Tom Morello reiterated that fact in his passionate, eloquent, and all-around wonderful Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech. KISS was despised by critics, feared by parents, and literally demonized by some religious zealots. As Morello said, “KISS was never a critic’s band. KISS was a people’s band.”</p><p>“Over time, the people on the street became the critics; the people on the street became the executives; the people on the street outlived the critics,” Stanley says. “That's part of our victory celebration – the fact that we have outlived the critics and the naysayers – and in essence our fans have taken over.”</p><p>KISS fans, or the KISS Army, as they are known, are among the most avid, most dedicated fans in music. Many have stuck with the group through good times and bad over its entire 40-year history.</p><p>“It's incredible to come back to cities and see multi-generations of fans. It's a source of pride for us that we can have a six-year-old, a 16-year-old, and a 60-year-old in the audience, and we’re all part of this tribe,” Stanley says. “I think you can’t have the kind of dedication that we have from our fans unless they sense the same dedication to them from us. The only way that you can be in KISS is if you have the ultimate respect, not only for the band, but for the fans, because they're intertwined. We may not always do what makes every fan happy, but we stick to our guns and we do what we believe in.”</p><p>Stanley believes there’s a reason classic rock artists like KISS appeal not only to older fans, but to a growing segment of young fans as well.</p><p>“The reason people still buy tickets to see the classic acts is because you know we will deliver the goods,” he says. “There are countless acts nowadays that have downloads in huge numbers, but you don’t want to go see them live, because they haven't learned their craft. They sing on a song that was put together in somebody's living room on a computer and then auto-tuned. You know damn well that those people are not going to be able to put on a show.</p><p>“The ones who have enough money to put on a great show are invariably dependent upon a bunch of dancers jumping over each other and a microphone that isn't turned on,” he adds. “I don't want to hear this nonsense that it's impossible to dance around and sing. It didn't stop the Temptations. It didn't stop Ike and Tina Turner. It didn't stop James Brown. When you come to see KISS, you know that you're seeing the real deal – something that has been proven time and time again.”</p><p>Some things have changed for Stanley and KISS. Once a rock and roll bad boy, he’s now a married father of four.</p><p>“Clearly there was a time when backstage was hedonism at its finest,” he says. “When you're given the keys to the candy store you tend to eat a lot of candy. I certainly had a sugar high. Over the years that obviously changed. I now look over to the side of the stage certain nights and see my little ones in their pajamas waiting for the show to be over to go to bed.”</p><p>Stanley says his primary motivation for performing with KISS has not changed, however.</p><p>“The core of why I got into this and the reason the band got together in the first place was to make music,” he says. “I think we've all grown into a different realm of our lives. I've got a family and the Bacchanalia that was backstage at one point is not there anymore. But the celebration at the core of it – which is celebrating life and the freedom to be who you are – has never changed.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Here are the remaining dates on the KISS/Def Leppard 2014 Summer Tour:</p><p>August 1 -      Xfinity Center -                                   Mansfield, MA</p><p>August 2 -      Boardwalk Hall -                                Atlantic City, NJ</p><p>August 3 -      Susquehanna Bank Center -                Camden, NJ</p><p>August 5 -      Saratoga Performing Arts Center -      Saratoga Springs, NY</p><p>August 6 -      Nikon at Jones Beach Theater -          Wantagh, NY</p><p>August 8 -       Farm Bureau Live -                            Virginia Beach, VA</p><p>August 9 -       Toyota Pavilion -                                Scranton, PA</p><p>August 10 -     The Xfinity Theater -                           Hartford, CT</p><p>August 12 -     Molson Canadian Amphitheatre -         Toronto, ON</p><p>August 13 -     Darien Lake Performing Arts Center -  Darien Center, NY</p><p>August 15 -    Alpine Valley Music Theater -               East Troy, WI</p><p>August 16 -    First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre -      Tinley Park, IL</p><p>August 17 -    Target Centre -                                     Minneapolis, MN</p><p>August 20 -    Wells Fargo Arena -                             Des Moines, IA</p><p>August 22 -     Klipsch Music Center -                        Noblesville, IN</p><p>August 23 -     DTE Energy Music Theatre -                Clarkston, MI</p><p>August 24 -     First Niagara Pavilion -                         Burgettstown, PA</p><p>August 26 -     Blossom Music Center -                       Cuyahoga Falls, OH</p><p>August 28 -     Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre -           Maryland Heights, MO</p><p>August 29 -     BOK Center -                                      Tulsa, OK</p><p>August 31 -     Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion -         Houston, TX</p>

WWE news: Stephanie McMahon accepts SummerSlam bout against Brie Bella
";i:4;s:15:"
July 29, 2014
";i:5;s:2909:"
<p>According to a July 28 <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2144550-stephanie-mcmahon-to-face-brie-bella-at-2014-summerslam-ppv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">post from</a> Bleacher Report, <a href="/topic/wwe" class="inline_link">WWE</a> head honcho <a href="/topic/stephanie-mcmahon" class="inline_link">Stephanie McMahon</a> formally accepted a bout against <a href="/topic/brie-bella" class="inline_link">Brie Bella</a> for next month's <em><a href="/topic/summerslam" class="inline_link">SummerSlam</a></em> pay-per-view spectacular in Los Angeles. McMahon and Bella have been feuding for months, as they have been going back and forth with verbal jabs and slaps to the face. McMahon was sent to jail last week on <em><a href="/topic/wwe-monday-night-raw" class="inline_link">WWE Monday Night Raw</a></em>, after she was spotted slapping Bella in the face.</p><p>Bella <a href="http://whatculture.com/wwe/stephanie-vs-brie-bella-confirmed-wwe-summerslam.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">then confronted</a> McMahon on this week's episode of <em>WWE Monday Night Raw</em> in Houston, threatening to take her to court for assault and battery unless she was given her job back. McMahon happily agreed to give her Bella her job back, but the divas superstar had one more stipulation. She told McMahon that she wanted to wrestle her at <em>SummerSlam</em>, and that she would take her to court if she didn't accept.</p><p>McMahon <a href="http://fansided.com/2014/07/29/wwe-raw-report-july-28-2014-brie-bella-nearly-ruins-whole-episode/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">showed off</a> some impressive acting skills, and she stole the show with a final segment that included the two ladies going at it inside the ring. McMahon accepted the <em>SummerSlam</em> bout against Bella, before slapping her in the face and tossing a microphone at her. The crowd on hand for <em>WWE Monday Night Raw</em> in Houston was absolutely loving the action.</p><p>Of course, McMahon and Bella are friends and business associates in real life. The assault and battery charges were just part of the WWE's scripted storyline, and fans shouldn't get it mixed up with real life. It will be interesting to see how the WWE scripts the McMahon vs. Bella feud in the days and weeks ahead. There are still three weeks to go before <em>SummerSlam</em>, so the WWE has plenty of time to hype the feud to the max.</p><p><em>SummerSlam</em> is set for next month at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. McMahon going toe-to-toe with Bella in the final segment of <em>WWE Monday Night Raw</em> represented a historic moment in women's pro wrestling, as it was one of the few times the promotion scripted a pair of females to cap off an episode of the long-running series. Elsewhere on <em>WWE Monday Night Raw</em> in Houston, Paige continued her feud with AJ Lee and John Cena defeated Cesaro after confronting Paul Heyman.</p>

Did ‘Bachelorette’ producers tell Nick Viall to shame Andi for fantasy suite?
";i:4;s:15:"
July 29, 2014
";i:5;s:2751:"
<p>Oh no he di’int! On Monday night’s “The Bachelorette” finale update show, rejected runner up <a href="/topic/nick-viall" class="inline_link">Nick Viall</a> came face to face with former love <a href="/topic/andi-dorfman" class="inline_link">Andi Dorfman</a>. And the disgruntled 33-year-old Wisconsin native wasted no time in calling her out for leading him on.</p><p>Monday’s <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelorette/episode-guide/season-10/12-after-the-final-rose" rel="nofollow">“After the Final Rose”</a> special aired live on ABC, much to the embarrassment of Dorfman. The former Atlanta assistant district attorney seemed absolutely stunned when Viall called her out for their intimate fantasy suite rendezvous just days before she dumped him for Josh Murray.</p><p>After Dorman admitted to Viall and the entire world that she was never actually in love with him and reminded him that she was careful never to tell him that she was, the rejected bachelor told her that her actions led him to believe that she did indeed love him.</p><p>“Feeling like you did, if you knew how in love with you I was, why did you make love with me?" he asked.</p><p>The stunned “Bachelorette” star was clearly unraveled by the awkward question, and she didn’t look at all happy by Viall’s personal revelation. “First of all I think that's kind of below the belt and something that should be kept private,” she snapped. But Dorfman did acknowledge that the things she told Viall at the time “were real.”</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nikki-ferrell-blasts-bachelorette-producers-rants-at-abc-on-twitter-2014297" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Us Weekly</a>, one show alum doesn’t think Viall’s confrontation was all that real. Nikki Ferrell, who won Juan Pablo Galavis’s heart on last season of “The Bachelor,” took to Twitter after the July 28 broadcast to post: “Gee I wonder who told Nick to say that … How the producers of @BachelorABC sleep at night is beyond me. #trash."</p><p>If  Ferrell’s take on how things went down is true, it certainly wouldn’t be the first time “Bachelor” producers have had a hand in stirring up drama. During Galavis’s season, producers actually turned against their own “Bachelor” star and his final pick during the “After the Final Rose” update, with host Chris Harrison mocking the fact that the Galavis hadn’t yet said that he loved Ferrell.</p><p>For this season of the show, Dorfman ended up not only expressing her love, but also accepting a proposal from 29-year-old former baseball player Josh Murray. No word yet on how Murray feels about his fiance’s recent bedroom business with another man.</p>
