Chase Rice teams up with Snagajob, reaches #1 on iTunes with ‘Ignite the Night’
";i:4;s:15:"

";i:5;s:3373:"
Most artists can only cross their fingers and pray to land somewhere near the top of the charts with their latest album. Country artist Chase Rice has landed at #1 on the iTunes country albums chart this week … and his album isn’t even out yet.Preorders for Rice’s first full-length album, “Ignite The Night,” have skyrocketed him to the top. The album doesn’t come out until Aug. 19, but thanks to the success of his first single “Ready Set Roll” and multiple preorder packages available on his website, fans have put the album in the top position on the country album chart and in the top 20 for albums overall.The Chase Rice marketing machine has been working full force this summer: Chase is currently on tour opening for Dierks Bentley, and will continue to tour throughout the summer and fall, including a stop at the sold out Watershed Festival at The Gorge in Quincy, WA. He has also partnered with Snagajob for their 3rd annual Hourly Gig contest.The Hourly Gig contest is geared toward giving hourly workers or job seekers the chance to pursue their musical dreams. Wannabe artists upload a video of themselves (or their band) performing an original song (note: cover songs not allowed) for a shot at winning an all-expenses paid trip to Denver to open for Chase Rice on Sep. 5.During a phone interview conducted last week, Chase talked about how excited he was to be a part of The Hourly Gig contest this year. He knows how hard it is to break into the music business, the country scene in particular. He noted that he was proud to be involved in something that would help another artist achieve what he is just now getting a taste of. In addition to that, he couldn’t believe that the winner would be the opening act for him at his show in Denver, Colo., when he himself is used to being the opening act.For some Rice’s rise in the country music scene was expected. He is, after all, one of the co-writers of Florida Georgia Line’s smash hit “Cruise.” But how he began his rise may surprise a lot of people. He was a star linebacker for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill until an injury forced him to the sidelines. After college he joined the Hendrick Motorsports pit crew, where he was a rear tire carrier on the NASCAR circuit for the Ryan Newman. Some may even recognize from television. In 2010 he was selected as a cast member for “Survivor: Nicaragua” and came in second place, losing to winner Jud “Fabio” Birza by one vote. When asked during the interview whether he thought his stint on “Survivor” had helped boost his fledging music career, he was quick to point out that while winning would have helped to get the album recorded financially, he has still put in a lot of hard work to get to where he is today, all without using his participation in the show as a way to get doors opened.For more information on Chase Rice’s album “Ignite the Night” and upcoming tour dates, check out his website at www.ChaseRice.com.For more information on Snagajob’s contest The Hourly Gig, go to www.thehourlygig.com. Video submissions are being accepted through Aug. 8. The winner will be announced on Aug. 29 and will perform as the opening act for Chase on Sep. 5 in Denver. Past winners include Ben Gallaher (2012, opened for Brantley Gilbert) and The Darlins (2013, opened for Montgomery Gentry).

Farm Aid announces 2014 concert date and lineup

This morning Willie Nelson and the fine folks with Farm Aid announced that Farm Aid 2014 will take place on September 13, 2014.  It will be held in Raleigh, North Carolina at Walnut Creek Amphitheatre.The 2014 Farm Aid concert lineup includes several regulars, as well as newcomers to the concert series. Entertainers include Willie Nelson &amp; Family, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, Dave Matthews &amp; Tim Reynolds, Jack White, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Jamey Johnson, Delta Rae, Carlene Carter, Pegi Young &amp; The Survivors, Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real, and Insects vs Robots.Farm Aid will highlight independent family farmers as essential to the well-being of our country. All across the country, family farmers are rebuilding local and regional food systems, re-energizing the economy, taking care of our natural resources and growing the good food we need as healthy citizens. Through the dedicated hard work of its board of directors, the support of many thousands of donors and the nearly four hundred artists who have generously donated their time and performances, Farm Aid is the longest running benefit concert series in America.Since 1985, Farm Aid has helped grow the Good Food Movement. More and more people want to know where their food comes from, how it’s grown and who grows it. The success of this movement is why there’s a vegetable garden on the White House lawn, a national conversation about what our kids eat, and increasing political will to broaden access to fresh, healthy food and investigate the stranglehold that corporations have on our food system.As farming once again becomes a viable career choice, more people are becoming farmers, replenishing our country with new ideas and innovations, growing local and regional economies, contributing to our national economic recovery, taking care of our natural resources and ensuring good food from family farms for everyone. This is Farm Aid’s hope and vision for a new American agriculture.Tickets for Farm Aid 2014 will go on sale to the public on Friday, August 1, at 10 a.m. EDT. Tickets will be available at www.livenation.com, the Walnut Creek Amphitheatre box office, all Ticketmaster outlets or by phone at 800-745-3000. Tickets range in price from $49 to $175.For more information about Farm Aid, North Carolina food and agriculture issues, and Farm Aid’s event policies, visit www.farmaid.org.

Bounce Boat featuring Capital Cities, Brenmar, Solidisco and more

";i:5;s:2159:"
This past Friday concluded the world's premiere dance cruise, Bounce Boat Summer July 2014 tour, featuring the world's elite DJs and talent. The highly anticipated July tour past lineup included: Just Blaze, Minnesota, Willy Joy, Buku, Mike Hawkins, Designer Drugs. This weekend was no different with 200+ who attended this Friday's finale featuring DJ sets by Capital Cities, Solidisco and Brenmar. If you're seeking an escape from New York's cliche nightclub scene of long lines, ridiculously priced drinks and obnoxious exclusivity, Bounce Boat is the solution for you! Enter the luxury, Hornblower Infinity, featuring three tiers with a sky deck, a powerful sound system and various amenities - but's that's only the beginning. Once you enter Bounce Boat, there's no turning back and obviously why would you want to turn back? Once the boat takes off across the Hudson, you have no choice but to dance. From the free-spirited, diverse crowd, the music and the amazing view of New York's greatest landmarks in a nutshell. In addition, when it comes to the music, there's something for everyone, from old school dance classics, deep house, techno, hip hop, pop - there's definitely options.  Speaking of options, one of the perks besides the spacious room of the Hornblower Infinity is having two different rooms with two different DJs for your listening pleasure. You step into one room and a old-school, Sean Paul, reggae jam is playing and then you step into the other room adjacent and a sick, mash-up of Daft Punk is blasting. Bounce Boat does not disappoint at keeping the energy at the ultimate high for the duration of the event, a total of four hours, as well as, the crowd, of course. The crowd, a diverse mix of young professionals, music enthusiasts, and people who just want to have a damned good time. To sum it up, the Bounce Boat experience goes hand and hand with the phrase, "If you're not having fun, then it's your own fault." Bounce Boat (Bounce Boat Media Group) has a lot more surprises in store for the duration the Summer 2014. For more information, tickets, and more visit the official site, Facebook and Twitter of Bounce Boat.

Ed Sheeran tops U.K. album charts for fifth consecutive week with ‘X’
";i:4;s:15:"
July 28, 2014
";i:5;s:2291:"
Ed Sheeran continues to enjoy success with his sophomore album ‘X.’ According to Billboard.com, the album has started a fifth week atop the U.K. album chart on Sunday (July 27).  The accomplishment lands Sheeran in some cool company.  It is the longest consecutive run at No. 1 since Adele’s breakout album “21” enjoyed similar success in 2011 and “X” is also the longest-running No. 1 album by a British male solo artist since James Blunt’s “Back To Bedlam.”With hits such as “Sing” and “One” and “Don’t,” Sheeran’s album has passed the 400,000 sales mark.  The 24-year-old singer still has a ways to go to beat Adele, who spent 11 consecutive weeks at number one with “21.”  The success of “X” can be attributed to Sheeran’s growth and evolution as an artist.In an interview with MTV, the “Lego House” singer discussed how his success stems from his ability to constantly evolve and keep his fans interested.  He said, “[‘Sing’] felt like the furthest away of anything I have ever done, and I would prefer to be talked about than not talked about and sticking out a song that makes everyone go ‘huh?’”He feels his unpredictability and willingness to change his style is what keeps fans on their toes and keeps him “cool” to them.  After making a name for himself with his first album “+,” Sheeran has figured out a way to achieve even more success with his follow-up album.  It has transcended him to an international superstar.  He found improving on the first album to be rather easy.He told MTV, “I think it was a great stepping stone, it opened all the doors it need to, and I would say there are some songs on that album that I would put on this album.  But I’ve evolved as a musician, my tastes are different and my experiences have changed, and for me it was quite easy to improve on it.”Ed Sheeran doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon.  His current single “Don’t” is rising on the charts and also has people talking and speculating over who the song is about.  The song appears to be an angry song, but that emotion infused into the lyrics has brought about the type of attention to the song that Sheeran referred to as a means of keeping fans on their feet when it comes to his music.

Lights, cameras, confetti! A night with OK Go
";i:4;s:15:"
July 27, 2014
";i:5;s:4643:"
Its been 4 years since LA artists OK Go have played in San Diego. Their third album, Of the Blue Colour of the Sky released in 2010 and since then Damian Kulash, Andy Ross, Tom Nordwind, and Dan Konopka have kept busy releasing B-sides, covers, mobile app games, and making various television appearances. In that time, they also have managed to write and record a new album, Hungry Ghosts, which is set to release in October of this year.Reaching fame from their viral hit “Here It Goes Again,” in which they won a Grammy for Best Music Video in 2007, the band has grown to be known for their creative and often low budget music videos, many of which are filmed in single takes. Like an M.C. Escher picture in motion, the latest video for the new single “Writings on the Wall,” is a single take video utilizing optical illusions to trick the viewer. From a giant Rube Goldberg machine to stop motion on toast, their videos, much like their live shows, are a synesthetic blend of visual multimedia and music, often pushing the limits of what’s possible and reminding viewers of the various outlets of artistic expression.Their west coast tour ended in Solana Beach Thursday night at the Belly Up Tavern. The venue, much smaller to their normal show, packed in a sold out crowd of eager fans both old and new. A large cheesecloth curtain sprawled out between the stage and the audience. The lights dimmed and projected upon the curtain were video clips of television and movies that introduce the band by saying "OK" and "Go." The band came out, and many seemed to think that the curtain would fall. But it didn’t. Instead, in true OK Go style, the curtain was there to serve as more than a canvas for an introduction. The set opened with “Upside Down and Inside Out,” off of their Hungry Ghosts album. This time, the projections included obscured video of the band members faces, singing along and mixing together to create unrecognizable personas. It wasn’t until the third song, “The Writing’s on the Wall,” the band’s newest single that the curtain finally fell, breaking down any disconnect the curtain may have created.The first half of the show seemed to mostly focus on OK Go’s newest songs, which were released in their EP Upside Out, a preview for Hungry Ghosts. Though released only recently, many in the audience sang along. It wasn’t until “This Too Shall Pass,” one of their more commercially well-known tracks, where the audience really woke up. Kulash, now without a guitar, jumped into the crowd to sing the last part of it, prompting a sing along from the audience and receiving an addition of some of the night’s confetti being thrown from the fans. Returning back to the stage, everyone shed their instruments for the performance of “There’s a Fire.” Much like their older hand bells renditions of various songs, this would involve the entire band stripping down a song to its key elements in an incredibly clever way. Kulash prompts the crowd to make specific noises to imitate parts of the drum, records, and with the rest of the band, loops the sounds together to create this version of an old fan favorite.Afterwards, the band left the stage while Kulash returned to the crowd, this time for a solo performance of “Last Leaf.” Another mesh of songs from all of their albums, including “Get Over It,” “Do What You Want,” and personal favorite, “Skyscrapers,” the band powers through until  “Turn Up the Radio,” another new song. Throughout, the band keeps up high energy, backed by bright neon lights (on a set designed by Peter Glantz), more projections and a continuous stream of confetti. The encore had the boys playing their last new song of the night, “The One Moment,” and finishing up with their mega hit, “Here It Goes Again.” Though the band had finished up, the night wasn’t over for the audience. As the house lights came up, the amount of confetti that poured upon everyone throughout the night became apparent, turning grown adults into 10 year-old kids again. Confetti fights began, confetti angels were made, and much of it lost in pockets of bags, shoes, hoods, and hair.OK Go still continue to be my personal favorite live band, often raising my expectations of other artists. Their combination of aesthetic focus mixed with incredibly catchy songs and stage presence make the band everything that I love in a show. They can make a fan out of anyone that attends, so check out their tour (as it returns from Japan) which will take them around the country in support of their newest album, Hungry Ghosts, which drops October 14th.

Get ready to saddle up and take a journey through the Old West, just like of the pioneers, cowboys, miners and gunfighter might have done in the 1800s. On August 3 and 4 at the Star Theater, the self proclaimed “psychedelic western influenced cinematic rock band”, Spindrift, will be passing through Portland as the band screens for the first time, their 2012 film Spindrift – Ghost of the West, that was shot on location throughout their 21-ghost town tour of West, and providing a  present day reflection on their journey back in time filmed in the present day.Over the band’s twenty-plus year career, Spindrift has experienced numerous changes, both personal and personnel, from its beginnings in Newark, Delaware in 1992 to the band’s move West in 2001 to Los Angeles. Today, founding member, band leader and current wagon master, Kirpatrick Thomas, has been the guiding force of its ambitious film and music projects. In addition to holding down his songwriting, composing, producing and acting duties, guitarist Thomas will be joined by Henry Evans on bass and baritone guitar, Parisian Thomas Bellier on guitar and vocals, and James Acton drums and autoharp. Their current press release reveals more about Spindrift’s film project, a ghost town tour of the Western U.S., having performed live at national parks, historical sites, vast deserts, and strange and forgotten locations. Bringing a director along with them, they put together an original film— Spindrift - Ghost of the West -- which is full of hauntingly gorgeous landscapes set to a soundtrack of trippy, reverb-soaked tracks. The official soundtrack was released last year on Tee Pee Records, but this summer marks the first-ever screenings of the film.Heavily influenced by such bands as The Doors, My Bloody Valentine, Hawkwind, Bruce Haack, and Chrome, Spindrift’s early stages were heavier, experimental, and differed greatly from their present Ennio Morricone inspired sound. In a recent phone interview with Thomas, he elaborated about Spindrift’s musical journey and his excitement of the upcoming tour. He shared his personal revelations and transformation of the ghost town experience, and the intrigue and allure of the American West.Starting with what has Thomas’ and Spindrift’s inspiration has been after twenty years of performing he replied, “I say it’s a labor of love that has paid off in all sorts of ways. It’s crossing the boundaries of something I do out of passion and the need to do music. But it’s also now turning into a small business of sorts”, citing their recently signed publishing contract with the major licensing company Chrysalis/BMG in April.Thomas enthusiastically continued, “We really get a kick out of doing projects about the Western United States in particular, and Western cinema, that’s what our expertise has been and where our passion lies. And it goes from wanting to do the kind of music that has an expansive sound, and searching for a style of music that is large and widespread when you hear it – big twangy guitars, big, wide, deep vocals. Like epic pieces of music that are slow and make you feel you’re somewhere else -- some vast, giant, endless sort of place -- that’s the kind of thing we like to portray with our music and I think the West does that the best.”When envisioning the Old West, images of pioneers, ranchers, miners, cowboys and gunfighters all come to mind. Wondering where Thomas fit in those characters he thoughtfully responded, “I am a traveler, an anonymous witness recording and reporting what should be spoken about, sung about, and with a melody. A person that needs to report on what’s out there, and my best form of medium of communication is music.”Asked what was Spindrift’s Manifest Destiny to the West was and Thomas explained, “One of the reasons I left the East Coast is because I felt the Spindrift was being constricted. I didn’t feel like it was a place we could grow. We needed that expanse to grow, which was good for us.Thomas continued, “It’s interesting, the band started on the East Coast, making our way to the West Coast. And how are careers as musicians opened up, and as people, and our lives. It’s the classic pioneer goes west, “the grass is green on the other side”, you know, or the grass is browner on the other side”, adding with reflective laughter.  “And that’s interesting to say. It was a classic American type of trip. Our journey when Spindrift went from East Coast to West Coast, all happened the usual way you kind of read about, like with the pioneers. You go through the ups and downs, you go through the rocky terrain making it out to the West. Then, you gotta make due for yourself once you’re out here. You’ve gotta stake your claim and I think we’ve done that. Definitely moving out here is the greatest thing I could have done for myself. It’s changed my life completely and I don’t regret it one bit. Nor do I regret growing up on the East Coast and getting the band started over there. It’s just been what the journey’s been all about.Spindrifts’ embrace of cinematic musical scores have an infused western music element, and has been featured in numerous films and shorts including The Legend of God’s Gun, The Legend of Widower Colby Wallace, and Dark Brown, the later which will be shown as part of the August 3 presentation, and speaks to the Spindrift experience. Thomas shared about how that inspiration came about before saying, “I think when we moved out West, when I saw the expanse and horizons on all kind of levels, the music started to really, really transcend what we were looking for. In that sense, musically interpreting what the West is about, and the views that I see is what’s most important for Spindrift. But as far as reporting on the West, I’m also intrigued by the history of the West, and I’m also intrigued by how it’s perceived, and where it can go and what it will be in the future.”Thomas continued, and reflected on what the Ghost of the West experience meant, “I think doing the ghost town tour that we did in October 2012, where we traveled across the American West for five weeks, we played in 21 different ghost towns (including stops in the Mojave Desert, Brisbee and Tombstone, AZ, up through Wyoming, and on to Deadwood, South Dakota), and some western museums and monuments ( Cathedral Gorge State Park and Arizona’s Sonoran National Desert), and we filmed and documented the whole trip(with Director Burke Roberts, Cinematographers J. T. Gurzi, and Rich Ragsdale). It was done out of the love of the old-style western music, the old cowboy songs -- that was number one. And number two was, the love of the history and being in the West. It’s one thing to be in the West, to take those songs back to where they were born and perform them in the towns where they grew. Perform them on the range, on the trailheads, to perform on the reservations.”With a 4x4 and film crew in tow, they captured the group traveling, performing and visiting each destination. Thomas recalled some of what the “observer” experience was like. “We were alone for quite some time playing to nobody but ghosts and cows. And every once and awhile, the strange onlooker that would just show up, you know. A lot of places we had to travel by a 4x4 vehicle. Then we had our van and it would get stuck in the desert and we’d wait for a whole day to get the thing towed out, probably typical things the pioneers went through, except without the cell phones.Getting back to Spindrift’s sound one might combine country and western music into one category but asking for musical clarification to the differences, Thomas provided the following insight about the two genres.  “I see Western as being more bent towards the cowboy way of life. And Western music is closely related to folk music, as well as other musical influences that come from other pioneers crossing the West. You could say the music of the Appalachians, which was the early West, and then Celtic music the cowboys were carrying across the plains during the cattle drives. I think that anyone who writes a song is influenced by their surroundings, and the way you perform a song is influenced by your surroundings, from primitive to advanced, especially with primitive. You only had the tools to use to make your music, and it reflected what the environment sounded like.But for the guys doing Carry Me Back to the Prairie, a classic western song, that is actually an old Celtic-Irish song. I also think that Western music is the state of mind of the cowboy, the heroic cowboy, and the stories that follow, and where a song might be written about to tell the tales of the cowboy. And obviously, you have the music of the cinema -- the genre of the Western -- like the Great Train Robbery. All the way back to the beginning of film, starting with the Western, you have quite a bit of history from the Western cinema starting it all off, which is another form of Western that is totally unrelated but tied in with it, so there is a relationship.And I would like to say that Spindrift is definitely a Western band. We do have country elements in our music, pedal steel guitar and the four-part harmonies Nashville-style, with some rockabilly influences. As far as Western, you can look at the classic Cowboy myth that we’re in love with as well as the cinematic ideals of the Western.”Even with the undeniable Western influence and stamp the band puts on its music, there is another distinct added element, psychedelia. Asked to expound on the band’s sound and how it applies today, specifically how does psychedelic apply to Spindrift’s music, Thomas replied, “Our earlier influences for Spindrift on the East Coast, as far as psychedelic is concerned was definitely an influence. We formed around college at the University of Delaware around 1991-92. There was quite a scene going on out there at that time and a lot of bands, in a little bubble of music was happening in the college scene. Every once in awhile these little towns have their time and place where they have a little thing that exploded, you know. And we just happened to be a part of that when that happened. There happened to be a good bit of chemicals floating around campus at that time, and definitely pushed us in a specific direction. It helped to create a more eye-opening experience to make definitively psychedelic music. I can’t deny that some our earlier songs were written under the influence of heavy psychedelics. We took that ideal and kept pushing it forward and touched to where it is now. Where you could say, there’s the idea of 60s pop culture, the psychedelic rock movement, and then there is how that influenced all the music that was happening at that time, everything from cinema to western cinema, like psychedelic western cinema from the 60s.As far as our version of psychedelic, I would probably have to say that early on it was  bent towards the actual chemically induced state. I also believe that later as we moved to the West Coast, honestly, we’d gone through this process and carried it with us, but now I think it’s more a state of mind, more a surrealist outlook. Being a fan of surrealist art and the movement, that was something I look towards as inspiration and how to come across with a new idea or new song, like a piece of music and throwing all these pieces together and making sense. That’s how this whole broad spectrum of psychedelic means to me. To some, it means one thing, and that is LSD, in another  way it means an outlook that means you’re crossing the feelings – taste, smell, sight, and hearing, crossing all those senses and you’re creating a whole new bubble out of it. I think the term “psychedelic” these days should probably redefined in Webster’s Dictionary, because there’s such a vast, broad use of the term these days. They have psych fests going on, all these different psychedelic festivals happening, and it’s a very popular musical title to be called these days. It’s interesting to have started when we did, in the early 90s, and to see it change over time. I feel like we’ve always kinda kept it with us in some sort or another.Although much of Oregon history is associated with Manifest Destiny, gold mining and settling of the West, did Spindrift’s 2012 Ghost Town tour include any stops in Oregon? “Oh no, I’m so sorry. After our performances August 3 and 4 we’re going to have a couple of days where we’ll get to visit some places. I gotta say though, there was one, The Safari Club (closed in March 2013). We did visit there and were trying to get a show happening there, and we were going to do that as a performance but it didn’t happen.But not only did we play ghost towns but we also played Route 66 style places towns like Tucumcari, NM. It looks like a Route 66 “death” town where you film a zombie movie or something, you know. We were trying to do Route 66 novelty places and The Safari Club was one of the places we were looking into performing at.Our tour really stretched, literally from the Southwest, like as far down as Bisbee and Tombstone on the Mexican boarder all the way up to South Dakota and Deadwood, we covered a pretty vast expanse. It was kind of incredible we were out for five weeks, 21 different ghost towns. We could have been out there a lot longer than that, there’s just so much, there really is, it seemed like there were places where we talked to the locals and they said check this out and check that out, and we’d show up at this place and nobody was there ever. It just seemed like it was set waiting for us to perform at, the most beautiful thing ever. I was looking at it like, you see all these videos with Rappers Pen Pen and rock stars living that lifestyle, but with Spindrift, if you’re going to do it that way, we’re going to do it this way. This is what our form of pimpin’ is, we’re going to go do this and it’s really going to be bad-ass. It’s our way of enjoying ourselves, and what the music can be and what it can do.”Having played Portland a couple of dozen times over the year, Spindrift has a growing following in the Northwest, and is one of the bands favorite places to play and visit. With their upcoming show being a multi-media event what can fans expect? Thomas’ excitement continued by saying, “Got say, Portland is a very important place for us to present the film with the soundtrack. We’ve been to Portland many times, we’ve performed there many times, many times. Love it, love it. One of the best cities in the United States, I think. If it wasn’t for the rain and the grayness, I’d be up there more often, but that definitely not enough to keep me away.”I think it’ll be a great show. The Star Theater is an excellent venue to see it at, where we’re doing two nights there. The first night, August 3rd, we’re going to do a double feature. The first movie is called Dark Brown, which is another film that Spindrift scored, which is a movie about the Lost Dutchman’s Mine out in the West. It’s kind of a suspenseful-horror movie and follows a group of hikers that discover how scary it can be at the mine. We have a song in that, which we’ll be screening, and then the band will perform music from both movies.I also believe that the Columbia Gorge International Film Festival (online schedule currently not available) is going to present the film on that night so that’s pretty good too. Then on Monday were going to do a regular show with a good variety of all of our songs spanning our whole career and we’ll have some support, good friends come up &amp; perform with us as well. We’ll have an ex-drummer and ex-guitarist/harmonica player up and will be joining up there on stage as well.You can say this is a whole new presentation we’re going to have. They’re going to get to see a movie and see the band perform the soundtrack live, and that’s a whole new experience. Spindrift doesn’t make it up there as much as we would love to, but we’re doing two nights so everyone can come and check us out. There are probably a lot of people in Portland that haven’t seen us yet. So we want to make sure everyone gets a chance to see this. It’s something really special. And when this film comes out, I really feel it’s a good piece of work and think it will transcend what people think about the west, and it’s going to help address what it is. It’s not just a regular story or a western, this is a story that happens in the West, this is more a story about the West -- what it is now, what it was and what it can be -- and it’s possibilities. And it encompasses the whole thing. I hope everyone can be there to witness what we’re coming up to present, and show some love up there.”For the very special presentation from the country’s premiere psychedelic western influenced cinematic rock band, Spindrift, and their inspired vision of the glorious Old West, past, present an future, be at the Star Theater August 3, which includes the screening of Spindrift – Ghost of the West, with separate questions and answer sessions with the band and director Tara Anaise, or the August 4 show that will feature music spanning Spindrifts catalog with Special Guests and former Spindrift band member. Tickets for August 4 are $12. 21 and over.

For someone not wanting to “Get too crazy on a Wednesday night” Alt-rock veteran Beck sure kicked up a storm for a maxed room out at the Pageant Wednesday.  Touring in support for his current effort ‘Morning Phase’ Mr. Hansen played a 20+ song set just over 2 hours. An apologetic nod for passing on St Louis the last 10+ years???  Perhaps, but either way fans soon let go of the past and were swept up into the frenzy.A balanced set list was perfectly executed, no easy task with room consisting of fans made up over 20+ years and 14 albums.  There were moments that certainly transported you back in time; You knew as soon as the melodies touched your ears that you had been there.  Favorite moments were the cover of Prince’s “Get  Real Paid” and the open jam feat; Beck delivering his lyrical ju-ju slang with lines like “Climb into my Hyndai” and “been trapped in the closet for 17 years with R. Kelly”. Even as some bemoaned the lull of having to sit through some of his newer stuff Beck definitely made up for it with the 3 song encore he slammed home for the StL fans.Setlist:1. Devil's Haircut  2. Black Tambourine  3. Novacane  4. One Foot in the Grave  5. Soul of a Man  6. The New Pollution  7. Modern Guilt  8. Think I'm in Love / I Feel Love  (Donna Summer cover)9.

Renaissance Festivals are a great place to set the modern world to the side and escape to an otherwhen and see performances from jousting, sword fighting, jugglers, fire eaters and concerts with music of another time.  The band Pirates and Wenches have been offering up their music at the Olde World Village with their own, original music and traditional shanties.Jared Vaden plays his violin and other instruments for the band.  Ramberto Bastell is on the guitar and brings a strong Spanish influence to their original music.  Ed Swarthout is on guitar, and his wife, Becca enchants the audience with her belly dancing.  The instrumentation is polished and beautiful.Renae Anderson is the lead vocalist and her voice is sweet and light even when her lyrics lean strongly towards the dark.  On some of traditional shanties, Ed sings the lead.  In contrast with Renae, Ed can be a bit pitchy, especially on "Off to Sea Once More" but on the old favorite, "Sloop John B", it is hard to refrain from joining in.Where the band really excells is on their original compositions.  Their ballads are beautiful and make the album worth the purchase.  "Black Widow" is a bit tongue in cheek song about a woman whose husbands had a penchant for dying at sea except for the fellow who brought a knife for a gun fight.  On "Shores of Los Hados" Renae is the lyricist and vocalist while Ramberto scored the music and it is composed and performed masterfully.    Despite a few weaknesses the CD is great and this song alone would have made the CD worth the purchase as well as four stars out of five.Sadly, their CD is not currently available anywhere but at their performances.  So you will need to catch them live and slip them a ten spot for your own copy.Pirates and Wenches, has been performing at the BlackRock Medieval Festival at the Olde World Village in August, Michigan this summer and will there for one last weekend on August 2 and 3.In the meantime, check out "Shores of Los Hados" on Youtube but pardon the background noises as this was recorded live near close with audience members and staff chatting near the camera.More about John N.

Vids from the Vault - Dylan - Changing of the Guards, Live 1978
";i:4;s:15:"
July 27, 2014
";i:5;s:3402:"
Along with "Street Legal's" Senor, Changing of the Guards is one of that album's most enduring songs. Senor at first captured everyone's attention, considered by many critics to be the only song worthy of Dylan on the record. Jack White and "The Dead Weather" resurrected  New Pony in recent years, in a dazzling version that utilizes the song's tensile strength and raw sexuality. Changing of the Guards hung around under the radar for a good long time, considered to be too wordy and obtuse, but then Patti Smith covered it in what this writer considers to be a rather lifeless version - you can hear it here for yourself. To me, Patti renders it preciously, under glass, like Baez did with a lot of Bob's early stuff, but regardless, she's Patti and she made it suddenly OK to consider the song hip.It is a great sprawling epic of a song, what it's about exactly is anyone's guess, but it's got some killer lines -gentleman, he said, I don't need your organization   /                                                                                                                   I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards   /                                                                            but Eden is burning.... either brace yourself for elimination   /                                                                               or else your hearts must have the courage for the   /                                                                                                                    changing of the guardsFirst rate apocalyptic Dylan, a song so chock full of imagery, so fable-like you could analyze it endlessly, finding plenty of comparisons to images in old literature but seen as a narrative, it's mainly a great surreal visual journey - rousing, mysterious, challenging, mournful, strange, beautiful. Someone's going to do the definitive version one day, like Jeff Buckley and Halleluiah. Chris Whitley and Jeff and Lang do a nice back and forth vocal trade on it, on Whitley's "Dislocation Blues," slow and spooky and it fits the subject matter, but there's a genuinely scary and transcendent version waiting to be captured in a jar.Then there's Dylan's live version seen in the video here, which is quite surreal, though not in any good way. Nashville, 1978. Word is that at the time, he'd become impressed with Neil Diamond's stage show (huh?!) and modeled his own tour on it, with flashy clothes and the big band, gospel girl chorus. At the end of the song he runs back and forth with his guitar, even running backward! like Prince or something, doing head bobbing with the guitarists, and you realize that this is his exit song... this huge undecipherable puzzle of a mythic epic and he uses it naturally to usher himself off stage, he puts down his guitar, awkwardly waves  and they go on playing on behind him in an instrumental vamp, ala Neil, who took it from Elvis, then Bob walks off and we're left counting our blessings that at least he didn't lift up his arms, back to us, to show them connected to a cape, whew.... but there he goes, yes ladies and gentlemen... BOB HAS LEFT THE BUILDING!That's what a divorce'll do to you, I guess. Interesting in its extreme bizzaritude, when time had done some kind of serious warp and things we're tilting off kilter in Bob's world, but hey, even then, the show must go on....

Some Remembrances of the 2014 Woodstock Folk Festival.

";i:5;s:1908:"
Were you at the 29th annual Woodstock Folk Festival on the green in Woodstock (duh) last Sunday, July 20? If not, you missed a classic great time, but this year with good weather. The tradition of stifling heat was broken this year, which may have contributed to the huge crowd that covered the green. Anybody who's anybody was in attendance (even some of us who are basically nobody).Among those seen in the crowd were local concert producers Paul Zimmerman (Maple Street Chapel), Dave Humphrey (Two Way Street Coffee House), Jim Craig (Hogeye) Betsy Ducote (Highland Avenue Coffee House),  Randy Styka (Acoustic Rennaisance) and Juel Ulven (Fox Valley Folk Festival. Media giants in attendance, besides "Folkstage" host and concert moderator  Rich Warren, were WDCB's Lilli Kuzma, and WNUR's Sue Kessel. Performers on a busman's holiday were Rich Prezioso and Jacquie Manning of Small Potatoes, Lee Murdock, Merv Collins, Norm Siegel, and Jim Craig (he wears many hats).  My apologies to all those I know I have missed. Of course, Chicago folk music house mother Ethel Polk was there enjoying the music - or it wouldn't have been a Woodstock Folk Festival.Congratulations to this year's lifetime achievement awardee, Andrew Calhoun. Andrew is a singer, songwriter, musician, president of Waterbug Records, and one of our great students of folk music history.  Being that Andrew is so young, we expect in a decade or two, he will return for Andrew's greatest hits, volume 2.The slide show here included, consists of photos shot by your humble Chicago Folk Music Examiner, who seldom left his spot on the lawn. A 14-1 zoom lens is a wonderful thing. Hopefully they are mostly in focus. Sorry, but our compouter decided to eat the picture of Amy Black.Enjoy the slide show, and we'll see you all at Fox Valley Labor Day weekend - if not before (like at the Stained Glass Coffeehouse extravaganza August 16).

Anathema ascends to new heights on stunning tenth album,  'Distant Satellites'
";i:4;s:15:"
July 27, 2014
";i:5;s:5414:"
Simply calling Anathema a "progressive British rock band" is understating a magical, emotional experience.  The best of the best tend to defy categorization.  To hurriedly slap a label on music this honest and full of beauty is, in a sense, disrespectful. Anathema is not casual background music.  Their music should not, and really cannot, be compared to a group of others.  It is intense, having undergone numerous changes over their 20+ years.  From the despondent and chillingly bleak nature that personified their earlier, darker material, Anathema's sound over recent years has expanded to also include a deeper, more varied spectrum of feeling.  Although the 'old' Anathema sounds completely different from the music they are now creating, the band has consistently remained distinctive and captivating, certainly a rare feat for artists with such a long history.It can quickly be concluded that Anathema's tenth studio album, Distant Satellites is more diverse than their previous two releases, We're Here Because We're Here and Weather Systems. This is not to say the predecessors were anything but fantastic. However, those who seek versatility in music are more likely to be pleased with this one, because no two moments on Distant Satellites are really the same -- yet it all works and flows so well.    It is nearly impossible to describe any of these songs as catchy.  There is a complexity tough to sum up present with this particular release.  Listening to a song or two from the album, then, is more difficult; Distant Satellites is best experienced from start to finish.   Those unacquainted with Distant Satellites will quickly learn to expect the unexpected, and it is a beautiful thing.   Each listen invites new observations; each time, something new stands out, one trademark of a truly special release.  Among the most spectacular offerings on Distant Satellites is the three-part "The Lost Song".  Parts 1 and 2 initiate the Distant Satellites experience -- as tracks 1 and 2, naturally.  "The Lost Song, Part 1" is immediately enchanting, with an unusual rhythm, utilizing the lovely vocals of Vincent Cavanagh and Lee Douglas.  It is a song full of hope,  gradually speeding up and becoming delightfully chaotic toward the track's end.  Cavanagh's cries of "The fear is just an illusion" provide an interesting transition to "The Lost Song, Part 2", a plaintive ballad focusing completely on Douglas' goosebump-evoking performance.  The way these two songs tie together is, in effect, brilliant.  The aforementioned line in the first installment of 'The Lost Song' morphs into the lament of "Can't believe it was just an illusion..."  Somehow, part 2 is both heartbreaking and optimistic.Pairing a mesmerizing piano melody with tremendously moving vocals from Douglas and Cavanagh,  "Ariel" is dreamlike, with one of the most breathtaking lines of the album, "Love so strong, it hurts..."   With this song, Anathema reaches new heights in emotion.  It is simply stunning in every aspect.  Guitarist/vocalist/main songwriter Danny Cavanagh's vocals perfectly end the song in a near-whisper during its final moments.  Not since "Dreaming Light" has the band made a song this captivating. True to its name, "Anathema" wonderfully encapsulates many defining characteristics of the band.  Nowhere else on Distant Satellites does despondent, pensive, and triumphant mix so flawlessly.  Again, the lyrics are a sure highlight: "But we laughed / and we cried / and we fought / and we tried / and we failed / but I loved you / I loved you."  Somehow, Anathema is gifted with the ability of pairing quite simple words together into something heart-wrenching and meaningful beyond compare.  The song reaches its pinnacle with a majestic guitar solo from Danny, perhaps the best one in the band's entire discography.  Clocking in at over eight mind-blowing minutes and composed by Anathema drummer John Douglas,  "Distant Satellites" has a light, electronic, spacey, floating feeling.  To sum it all up, Vincent Cavanagh has never sounded more incredible than he does on this excellent title track.   As terribly clichéd as this statement may sound, this is an ideal song to drive around aimlessly to, or to listen to in solitude and just space out for a while.   What a wondrous and remarkable atmosphere it creates.  It is a magnificent accomplishment by Anathema.Never a band to repeat itself, Anathema has, once again, unleashed something phenomenal.  Perhaps longtime listeners who felt indifferent about Anathema during the past few years should consider looking into this new outing, as it delves into new territory.  Even those unacquainted with the band would be wise to get this album.  Unquestionably, it will consistently be viewed as a defining moment in this band's career.  There are too many special qualities about it, both examining individual songs and while looking at the album as a whole, for this not to be the case.   People who really long to feel music deeply should look to Anathema.   There are numerous 'superlative' moments on Distant Satellites.  It is easy to lose count of how many times one can genuinely say, "that was the best _____ Anathema has ever done" during these ten songs.  Fifty-six minutes of pure, amazing expression, Distant Satellites is the top music release of 2014 so far, and it would be shocking if anything in the coming months matches it.

John 5 contemplates his axe
";i:4;s:15:"
July 27, 2014
";i:5;s:12366:"
John 5 is gearing up for the August 12th release of his eighth solo album Careful With That Axe.  Currently, he is heading out on a U.S. tour with Rob Zombie that includes a Michigan stop in Saginaw at First Merit Bank Event Park on September 27.Q:  Where are you at today?John 5:  I'm in the most amazing place in the world: Los Angeles.  I love it.Q:  Well you have a lot going on right now so let's get right into it.  When we talked last year, you were working on your eighth solo album and now it's done and being released next month.  Now that it's here how are you feeling about it?John 5:  I'm very proud of it.  I really took my time on it.  To be completely honest with you, it actually came out better than I thought it would.  It has these different musicians on it and it really brought the record to another level.  Matt Bissonette is playing bass on it and he just really killed it.  I was super, super happy with how it came out.  Rodger Carter played drums on it and he did such a great job.  The guy really was into it and I believe it really made a difference. Q:  Listening to the new album, it really weaves through so many different genres and styles.  What do you feel was the overall vision for Careful With That Axe?John 5:  Well it's really starting with the title of the album.  A lot of the idea behind the album comes from my childhood including the title.  You know, "careful with that axe", a guitar axe.  My parents gave me this guitar, my first guitar, and I remember my dad saying, well don't count on this as more than a hobby because this just isn't going to be a career, because I wanted to be a musician so bad.  I remember him saying it was a one in a million chance.  So that's kind of like where Careful With That Axe came from because when you receive a guitar, which is called a axe, you just don't know if it's going to bring you riches or poverty or happiness or sadness.  I mean, what's really going to happen with this axe?  Also, some of the song titles revolve around axe murders that happened in the United States.  When you look at the titles, it's like what is this, "Flight of the Vulcan Kelly"?  Well, that's kind of a take on the "Flight of the Bumblebee" because the vulcan kelly was a brand of an axe that was around in the late 1800 and 1900's.  So there's a lot of cool things like that on the album.Q:  Is there one track in particular where you feel you really nailed it?John 5:  I love "This Is My Rifle", of course.  I love listening to that but I also love all of the tracks because I'm playing them all live right now.  I love "Jerry's Breakdown" because it's really tough.  He had some really cool stuff like that, and you know, I really love the Elvis movies.  I just really love the record.  I know people always say that but I really do enjoy it. Q:  Going back to the mixing of the genres.  That's something that you have always done and it's a staple of Rob Zombie albums as well. What is your favorite thing about being able to break down boundaries like that?John 5:  Yeah, the reason I do that is also going back to my childhood I think.  I wanted to be a session musician and I knew that I needed to learn all these different styles of music.  So I started listening to all these different styles because I saw this movie called Session Man and I was pretty young.  I mean super young!  Of course I was very uneducated on what I was doing but from what little education I did have, I was like I have to know every type of music there is if I'm going to be a session guitar player.  So I started studying all these different types of music and it actually helped me with my career so much because it kept my brain occupied , not just by rock, but by all of these things.  To me it's all just music.  So it's all the same when I go in and record music.  If I stayed with just rock, I would get bored with it. Q:  You brought up "Jerry's Breakdown" but you also have another Jerry Reed cover on the album with "Jiffy Jam".  Why did you choose those?John 5:  Me and my dad, well my parents, loved Jerry Reed.  I remember listening to a lot of Jerry Reed growing up.  My dad would play the record and I would hear a song like "Jerry's Breakdown" and be like, oh my god, that's so cool!  It's just a part of my childhood.  I thought Jerry Reed was just a amazing talent.Q:  So will you be doing any touring for the album?  I know you're in the middle of touring with Rob Zombie right now.John 5:  Yeah, I'm glad you ask that because a lot of people have been asking me about that and wondering about what I'm doing.  What I'm going to be doing is a live-streaming concert and it's kind of going to be set up like the Tonight Show.  We're gonna play live all of the songs from the record.  It's going to be hosted by Chris Broderick from Megadeth and the people from the Jay Leno Tonight Show are kind of putting it all together.  I'm going to do three concerts because of the time changes.  It's gonna be so weird for people so I'm going to be doing like the American and Canadian one and then I'm going to do a Australia and Japan one and then I'll do a Europe one.  So it won't be like one concert where you're like, oh my god this concert's at one in the morning!  This way I can hit all the time zones.  It's gonna be so cool.  It's gonna be in October.  I'm so excited about it!  It's gonna be October 17, I believe.  I don't think anybody's really done this before and it's the perfect time to see me live in the perfect atmosphere in your living room and stuff like that.  People will be able to ask questions and there will be other cool stuff.  I think it's going to be really cool. Q:  Do you find the recording process to be drastically different when you are working on your solo albums compared to working on Rob Zombie albums?John 5:  I do.  It's very different because these instrumental records are really free in the process.  With Rob it's like I'm really trying to come up with the best stuff possible.  It's all about how these songs are going to sound live and you know looking for a certain pitch or whatever.  It can be difficult at times when I have all these cool melodies and riffs in my head but usually it's obvious what they are.  I mean some will really work great for the instrumental songs and there are certain types of riffs and melodies that work for Rob Zombie.  So it is two very different animals completely.Q:  So you are working on the new Rob Zombie album now.  I saw a interview recently where Rob described the new music as "f*cking weird", which made me laugh because I think that can be said about all of his music.  How do you feel the new music is coming out?John 5:  Well I do think it's weird but it's really good.  You know, you can always say it's weird but it's also really, really hooky too.  I've written so many times with Rob and we write so well together.  He is so great at writing music.  It's like writing a book.  It's great so we're just having a good time.  I'm so lucky that I have that relationship with Rob because so many people struggle to write together.Q:  You are heading out on a U.S. tour with Rob Zombie, which will be making a stop in Saginaw in September.  What can people coming out expect this time around?John 5:  It's just a total party.  What we're doing now is we're like getting the crowd involved and it's incredible and you can just see the crowd receive it.  We'll just do stuff like play a random song.  You just have to experience it.  It's just a crazy party.  It's dirty; it's filthy; it's like a big huge house party.  It's totally insane. Q:  You have the live DVD out now:  The Zombie Horror Picture Show and I feel like anytime you go to see Rob Zombie, it is a very sensory experience.  Were you happy with the finished product and how well it has been received?John 5:  Oh my god, I am so happy!  It is something that we've always wanted to do and Rob put a lot of time into it so seeing it do so well is so cool.  Now the interesting thing about making a live DVD is you know, being able to fix stuff in the studio because you know sometimes you have technical issues or whatever and it's live.  So when we did this, Rob was like okay, here's the deal, we are going to do this two nights and nobody is going to do any touch ups or fix anything.  That's why we have two nights so let's say something happens that we can't control, we have another night.  So it was so cool.  I remember sitting with the band, Piggy and Ginger, and we were like we've got to be really on our game here but we still have to move around.  So it ended up coming out so perfect but there is one fix on there.  Next time you watch it, check out my guitar solo on "Thunderkiss '65".  My volume knob comes off and I look at it and I throw it into the crowd.  I mean that has never happened to me in the ten years of touring with Rob and it happened at that moment at that time.  It was so weird.  But everything in there was completely live so I'm really proud of it. Q:  Is there one song that you never get tired of playing?John 5:  You know, I love "Thunderkiss" because I get my crazy guitar solo in there but there's not really any songs that I get tired of playing.  I do a little competition with myself to see how tight I can play it so I don't get tired of it.  I know that's weird but I just don't. Q:  Last time we spoke, we talked about how Halloween is your favorite holiday and about the first installment of Rob Zombie's haunted house/concert experience The Great American Nightmare.  You had said that you really enjoyed it and hoped he was going to bring it back this year.  I saw that it is indeed coming back and maybe doing some traveling this year.  Are you looking forward to that?John 5:  Yeah, I'm very happy that we're going to do it again.  I'm not sure where it's going to be at but it's going to be really cool.  We got such positive feedback on it. Q:  You are going to be working on the new Rob Zombie film coming up as well?John 5:  We really haven't started working on it yet but he asked me to do the score so I'm excited.  Doing that is always a lot of fun.Q:  What do you have coming up after this U.S. tour?John 5:  Well we are going to start concentrating on the new record.  So we're just going to be working.  There's always something going on, which I'm very happy and thankful for.  I like to stay busy. Q:  Yeah with your family, and touring and recording and working on your own stuff, it's gotta be hard juggling everything.  How do you do it?John 5:  I have no idea.  It's really hard.  That's the hardest thing.  It's tough, seriously.  I mean I like to do everything at home.  I'm that guy!  I'm the responsible one who is yelling, oh I got it, but when I'm not around, it's really hard.  So I'm doing my best.   Q:  What is the most rewarding part of being in the music business?John 5:  I just love having a guitar in my hands.  I love it.  It's like when you're a kid you have your blanket or your favorite toy;  I just love having my guitar. Q:  How many guitars do you currently own?John 5:  I don't know so I guess that many!  So many I don't know.  I'm just crazy about guitars.  They're all really beautiful.  I just have an absurd amount. Q:  Do you have a favorite?John 5:  I have two favorites.  My favorite one that I play all the time is my gold Telecaster, which I play on everything.  The one that is my favorite vintage one is a Fender Telecaster, which is just super plain and a gorgeous, gorgeous guitar.  Those are my two favorites.Q:  You recently hit up one of the Motley Crue shows, but what is the best show outside of your own that you've attended this year?John 5:  Well actually I'm going to see Paul McCartney at Dodger Stadium and I'm really super excited about that.  My whole family just grew up with the Beatles and stuff and I just never got a chance to see Paul because I've always been touring so I'm really looking forward to seeing that show.Q:  What is your favorite horror movie of all time? John 5:  My favorite horror movie of all time would have to be The Creature From the Black Lagoon.  I love that movie.  I love all the old Universal movies but that's my favorite and everyone always sends me stuff from the Creature From The Black Lagoon.Q:  Final words?John 5:  Just check out the new record and check out the live-stream concert.
